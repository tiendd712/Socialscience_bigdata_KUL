"t_201","I was born in Athens and grew up in Atalanti, Greece. I received my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2011. After fulfilling my military obligations in Greece (mandatory military service), I was employed as a data scientist/researcher at the Artificial Intelligence and Information Analysis (AIIA) laboratory in the project ATLAS. The project started in 2013 and lasted approximately 2 years. I gained valuable experience throughout that job. First, I was responsible for the creation of the database of the project. Next, my main task was the development of new machine learning-based recommender systems and I was also involved in the implementation of the prototypes in collaboration with the partner companies.  In the meantime, I started my MSc in Digital Media - Computational Intelligence, which I got in 2015. 

Towards the end of 2015, I decided to move to Belgium to pursue a PhD in machine learning and continue my career as a research staff member at KU Leuven. During that demanding journey, I succeeded in publishing many scientific articles in the field of machine learning and finally obtained my PhD in September 2019. My work focused on the development of novel machine learning methods to effectively mine biomedical interaction networks, such as drug-target interaction ones. Working in research helped me gain analytical thinking and develop a passion for innovation. I have also learnt to work both independently and as a member of bigger teams. Throughout my work at KU Leuven, I had the opportunity to work in a multicultural environment and present my work in several international conferences. Furthermore, I was involved in interdisciplinary projects, gaining valuable experience in collaborating with scientists from different disciplines, such as statisticians, clinicians, and psychologists. Next, I was a senior scientist in machine learning and AI at ITEC, an imec research group at KU Leuven. In that role, my task was to develop new machine learning models and methodologies applied to interaction networks from several fields, such as drug discovery or recommender systems. My project also aimed at building bridges between academia and industry, focusing on research valorisation. 

Currently, I am leading an AI for early drug discovery project. My tasks include the research and development of novel ML/DL models for hit discovery, scale up ML methods to massive datasets, processing small-molecule data from several databases, and virtual compound screening."
"t_202","Striving for excellence in remote sensing imaging.   

Since instrument design choices finally impact the quality of information for end users, every aspect of the value chain is important.  At VITO Remote sensing, I can count on more than 100 great co-workers with expertise on all these aspects.  Pushing forward the quality of imaging systems by combining the strengths of innovative methods, software and hardware elements is a challenge I gladly take on. Instrument design is a great field for putting physics into action. After developing image processing software for 30+ years, I find that the potential of smart algorithms is still growing. Now even AI approaches live up to their expectations. 

My journey in remote sensing started with instrument design, image quality analysis and radiometric calibration developments for the Proba-V earth observation satellite. Later, I contributed key parts of the software for innovative compact hyperspectral imagers for use in both UAV systems and small satellites, a work we now continue in the AQUALIS SmallSat image quality project. With great enthusiasm, I now also contribute to the realization of a dedicated satellite mission for monitoring marine litter."

Albert Einstein once said: ''The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."" As a child, I was always asking questions whenever I had the opportunity. Whether we'd just be driving around town, going to museums or even at a doctor's or dentist visit, I had some questions up my sleeve. I'm sure people thought I was annoying with these never-ending questions, but for me that was a way to learn and to hopefully find my passion by getting to know everything possible out there. 

Today, I'm proud to say that not much has changed. My curiosity has not diminished over time. Deep inside I'm still that child who loves to know and learn from others. Not from a point of wanting to be a smart-ass, more so for wanting to understand the world. I believe understanding the world starts with understanding your surroundings, whether it be the places you go, the people you meet or the events that occur. 

Over the years, I've learned the difference between types of questions you can ask. When is the time to ask certain questions, how to ask specific questions, what do you want to challenge with your questions,.. The right questions at the right time can have a tremendous impact.

In the future, I intend to continue doing what I do best: asking questions. Hoping this can help my clients in my current job, help my friends and family and encouraging them to talk, helping strangers find the beauty of questioning."

Additionally, you can find a rough portfolio of my work and learning experiences on my GitHub profile at https://github.com/majaminnaert.

While learning the basics, from ""print(""Hello World!"") all the way to implementing and using machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks with the Python stack, I dived into the mathematics of it and turned into a true math enthusiast! This really helps me be a very adaptive and versatile tech worker, since understanding the mathematics and being research oriented makes a great basis for further learning and understanding the systems we work with. My personal workflow is one where goal-oriented research, insatiable curiosity and deep understanding generate steep upward learning curves that help me envision and create the best possible solutions in an affordable time.

Before my technology career, I attained a Bachelor's degree in Social Cultural Work, focusing on group dynamics, team work, creativity and social diversity. Social work is basically about designing and implementing systems and solutions to empower people in a non-technological way. Hence, I am naturally inclined to seek out and envision technologies that seamlessly integrate with the dynamics of societies, groups, organisations and teams. Another key habit and skill I learned from social work is how to make sure end-users and stakeholders can participate deeply in informing the design of any solution or system. Together with my aforementioned tech skills, I believe these skills empower me to help create highly user-oriented products, services and analysis.

I look forward to combining my technical, mathematical and research skills with my prior social work skills to be strong both as a team player and as a creator of technological solutions! I am still learning a lot about the tech world and currently looking for an internship position or a job where there is still a lot of space to learn about the tech side of things. If you are interested in helping me on my learning journey and reaping the benefits of my way of thinking, make sure to contact me!"

I do:
- a slightly awkward keynote (or lunch & learn etc) ""Autism, technology and (almost) everything in between - the power of neurodiversity"": more info below
- media appearances (e.g. Taboe with Philippe Geubels on tv)
- column writing (e.g. Knack, see ""featured"" section)
- consultancy (e.g. how to do inclusion on/off screen for VRT)
- informative/training sessions 
- coaching of autistic people
- a blog/podcast @ 20angles.com

But why?
---
I grew up myself unaware of how I processed things differently. Luckily, I was able to fit in by slowly cutting pieces of my authentic self (why be happy if you can be ""normal"" right?).  However this has given me some hard-won wisdom, which I now want to use to help others. 

Neurodiversity keynote
---
I hope to co-create an environment within your organization where neurodiverse employees (no, that's not people with a ""defect brain"") feel an invitation to stay true to who they are, and where ""different brains"" are seen as unique strengths that help foster innovation. 

I nudge people towards developing a mindset of compassionate inquiry that can catalyze (by trial & error) a better collaboration in teams where not everybody is thinking the same way (thank God, that would be really boring). And, I stir people that find the things I say awkwardly recognisable to ask some important questions (no, getting a ""label"" doesn't have to be a heinous shame).

Unfortunately, we rarely get anywhere by overanalysing which inspirational quotes to put on our favorite wall (trust me, I tried). An improved modus operandi can only emerge by clearing up bias first (I unfortunately can't draw a city after viewing it from a helicopter), and having a nuanced deep understanding at its foundation.

I support my story with evidence-based data, personal anecdotes, analogies coming from my work in AI/genetics and most importantly, a good amount of silly jokes. Ironically, I'm even told I'm ""highly-engaging"" (see the testimonial of Pieterjan Bouten below).

During this phase of my career, I increasingly realized that my true passion lies in software development and the analytical challenges related to it. I subsequently quit my job at BNP Paribas Fortis, took 6 months for intensive self study and then, in September 2019, started as a Software Engineer (focus on front-end development) at Axians.

Having 7 years of experience in ETL-development using SAP Business Objects Data Services (BODS aka. BODI), building SAP BW DSO‚Äôs and using a mix of PL/SQL, Unix Bash-Scripts, Powershell, Python3 and C# to get it done, it is time to extend this with more popular (if very similar) technologies.

The plan is to expand my SAP experience (which btw. also includes Universe Design and BOXI reporting) with a more solid Microsoft branch. Most compagnies still use Windows Desktops and many leverage multiple Windows Servers and therefore there is little that can‚Äôt be resolved or automated if one has a solid C# background. After a more formal training at Syntra I'm doing some light OOP Gui-application design to train some skills.

Expanding on this C#-booster is SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services). This is the Microsoft ETL solution which is also written using Visual Studio. It has gained great popularity and has much overlap with BODS which would make a transition very feasible. SSIS itself also leverages C# for all the non-database-specific code an ETL-developer often requires. Momentarily we must await until Microsoft releases the SSIS module for ‚ÄòVisual Studio 2022 Community‚Äô.

I was just 6-7 years old at that time but I understood how to turn the computer on and was amazed by the sounds it produced (internet connection was still through phone that day).

Later on this passion kept growing throughout secondary school as I was studying engineering sciences, but more and more I also thought about applications. How can we use technology to help people improve their life, wellbeing, etc.

Simultaneously I was extremely passionate about basketball, when I got to 14-15 years old we got our first ""real"" smartphone and I remember that thing as being the portal to watching NBA games at 2 or 3 in the morning due to time zone difference.

When I went to university that's when a lot of these passions started to click together. My Master thesis was in bikefitting and everything all of a sudden made sense to me. It's a highly technical discipline, the best tech combined with expert knowledge will give the best results. On the other hand, you're helping people to become or stay active, help them to avoid injuries and enjoy their sport.

I have my bachelor in Civil Engineering. During my bachelor I worked as a Industrial designer at Europlasma. As a Industrial designer I had to design machine parts for plasma coating machines in cooperation with the R&D department. 

My first year of the masters was mainly focused on the human body and the technical aspects of medical devices. The first semester of my second master I studied at the University Politecnica de Madrid where my focused shifted to data science and machine learning applied in the medical field. I continued down this road in the second semester were I ended up choosing my thesis in machine learning. During this period I did an internship at PwC as a data-analyst intern at M&A.

After my experience with ML and as a data-analyst I was interested in the real life data architecture in Companies. Which persuaded me to start as a BI consultant at i.deeds. After successfully completing two green-field projects I knew I was more interested in the back-end architecture. This made me take the step towards data-engineering with Big Data at Cegeka."

"t_817","Hi, I channel the ""too-many-interests"" mode of my ADHD mind by working in AI/bioinformatics (where my autism is a big plus) whilst also advocating for my neurodiversity by speaking/consulting for organizations (e.g. Deloitte, P&G, Hubspot, Nexxworks).

I do:
- a slightly awkward keynote (or lunch & learn etc) ""Autism, technology and (almost) everything in between - the power of neurodiversity"": more info below
- media appearances (e.g. Taboe with Philippe Geubels on tv)
- column writing (e.g. Knack, see ""featured"" section)
- consultancy (e.g. how to do inclusion on/off screen for VRT)
- informative/training sessions 
- coaching of autistic people
- a blog/podcast @ 20angles.com

But why?
---
I grew up myself unaware of how I processed things differently. Luckily, I was able to fit in by slowly cutting pieces of my authentic self (why be happy if you can be ""normal"" right?).  However this has given me some hard-won wisdom, which I now want to use to help others. 

Neurodiversity keynote
---
I hope to co-create an environment within your organization where neurodiverse employees (no, that's not people with a ""defect brain"") feel an invitation to stay true to who they are, and where ""different brains"" are seen as unique strengths that help foster innovation. 

I nudge people towards developing a mindset of compassionate inquiry that can catalyze (by trial & error) a better collaboration in teams where not everybody is thinking the same way (thank God, that would be really boring). And, I stir people that find the things I say awkwardly recognisable to ask some important questions (no, getting a ""label"" doesn't have to be a heinous shame).

Unfortunately, we rarely get anywhere by overanalysing which inspirational quotes to put on our favorite wall (trust me, I tried). An improved modus operandi can only emerge by clearing up bias first (I unfortunately can't draw a city after viewing it from a helicopter), and having a nuanced deep understanding at its foundation.

I support my story with evidence-based data, personal anecdotes, analogies coming from my work in AI/genetics and most importantly, a good amount of silly jokes. Ironically, I'm even told I'm ""highly-engaging"" (see the testimonial of Pieterjan Bouten below).

As a young pup growing up in West-Flanders, I spent countless hours building and creating with construction toys. Logically, I set my sights on a career in bricklaying, eager to bring my visions to life.
As I got older and started (solo)traveling, I met and learned about different people from all over the world.

For me, the collision took place during my Erasmus in Denmark while I was working on a group assignment in which we explored different techniques to classify pictures of numbers.
After the assignment I enlisted for a second master's in AI and have been riding high on a wave of excitement and inspiration since, constantly amazed by the incredible possibilities that are being unlocked through the power of machine learning and AI.

The topic of my PhD was the development of techniques to allow the use state-of-the-art pedestrian detection algorithms to be used in real-life applications. The main obstacles that had to be tackled where the high requirement of both detection speed (allow real-time processing, even on embedded systems) and high accuracy (avoid missing pedestrians while still have a low amount of false detections). In the context of this task, I worked out two applications: 
1) ""The detection of pedestrians in the blind spot of trucks"" where a hybrid CPU/GPU implementation of an accurate pedestrian detection algorithm is combined with heavy search space reduction for high speed accurate pedestrian detection. 
2) ""following pedestrians with a drone"" in which all processing (pedestrian detection, pedestrian tracking, steering of the drone, ...) where calculated on an embedded system on the drone.

I am Ph.D. in Computer Science, specialized in the simulation and optimization of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, from the University Rovira i Virigli (URV) in Tarragona (Spain) with pre-doctoral internships at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (United States), Hiroshima University in Hiroshima (Japan), and Technical University of Berlin in Berlin (Germany). I have also graduated with a Master in Process Engineering from the URV and Catholic University of Leuven in Leuven (Belgium) and a Bachelor in Chemical Engineering from the URV. Additionally, in this constant path of learning, I have obtained certifications in Python, SQL, and R Programming from Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or Stanford University among others.

During these +15 years of my professional career, I have been working and leading teams in different areas of end-to-end Big Data and Artificial Intelligence solutions. From: 1) identifying the use cases in which the Business Partners can take advantage of precise data-driven decision-making processes, 2) analysing different data sources and creating solution architectures, 3) designing ETL Data Engineering pipelines in HiveQL when I was working with Hadoop, and PySpark or SparkSQL now with Spark, 4) developing descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive algorithms in Python to solve the business questions with data, 5) designing a visualization layer in BI Tools like Tableau or Power BI, and 6) the continuous implementation and deployment of these projects using an Agile Framework. In Big Data, I have worked first with Cloudera and Databricks distributions using Microsoft Azure, and later I specialized in Amazon Web Services Cloud Computing Data Lakes. In Advanced Analytics I mostly use SQL for the first analysis of the available datasets and Python for creating the heuristic rule or machine learning algorithms. My career path is therefore focused on implementing data mining solutions for Business Partners in the area of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods.

"t_1649","Let me introduce myself! 

I am Jan, a developer at heart with a big passion for IoT. 
Making devices smarter every day, that's what I do. 

In 2008, I started my journey after I graduated with a master 'Computer Science Engineering' at KU Leuven. 
I started as a developer but soon grew into several managing roles in the IT industry. 

During my career, I noticed a big pain point when working with remote devices. 
I was unable to access my remote devices efficiently and safely. 

To make my life easier, I developed an easy tool to create reverse SSH tunnels. 
I figured more ITers can use this tool, so at this moment Openport was born. 

Fast forward to today, I have 100s of happy customers and reached a milestone of 19 million successful sessions! 
And of course, the story doesn't end here, my goal is to keep on making the life of ITers easier. 

So if you recognize the struggle to reach remote devices as I did, feel free to reach out to me!

I have spent my bachelor years in METU NCC where I kept my grades high and had the chance to be an Erasmus exchange student at Technical University of Munich. I was also the president of Young Entrepreneurs Society but since I had to go to Munich, I resigned. After spending 6 months abroad, I returned to my home university and I was assigned as an assistant student ( that includes grading homework, solving exercises, explaining requested topics ) for Signals & Systems I course. In the last year of my bachelor studies, I took a course ""Image Processing"" which encouraged me to dedicate my career in computer vision / machine learning discipline. With that motivation, after having B. Sc. Degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering, I applied to KU Leuven (ranked as 48th in the world by Times Higher Education) for M. Sc. degree and got accepted.

During my studies in Leuven, I focused on CV/ML and took related courses like data mining, bio-informatics, artificial neural networks,  Digital Signal Processing for Communications and Information Systems. I also dedicated my masters Thesis ( Autonomous Flight for a Quadrotor using Single Image Based Obstacle  Avoidance ) to the same field. In my thesis CNN and SIFT features are extracted and then they are classified using support vector machines. This revealed that CNN features are able to pack much more information compared to SIFT features even though CNN features are smaller in size. You can see the outcome of my work here ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdu1zwkn-k0&t=0s ).

In order to apply life long learning principal to my life, I am now pursuing a Ph. D. in Hacettepe University Electrical & Electronics Engineering department. My Ph.D. will be about sensor fusion which aims to provide deep learning methods with more than RGB images.

My career began as a technician for amusement machines such as pinball, bingo, and billiards at Rus Tony Activities. When the company shifted its focus to gambling games, I decided to start my own side business, ""GePe biljarts,"" as an upholsterer for billiards tables. In 2012, I began working for Miko as a service technician for coffee machines, where I also gained some experience as a barista.

In my pursuit to become a software engineer, I returned to my studies and gained expertise in Point of Sale systems for the catering industry. At QNH, I worked on a .net Point of Sale system and later joined the company's loyalty program team, using Java.

My interest is research and the prototyping (maybe also a marketable product, which I have not done yet). Or in other words, I am a real-world problem driven researcher. 

Personally, I am aware of that part of me is virtuous yet many words and feelings in my mind are simply noise. I am able and willing to adapt, if the object is promising. On the other hand, for the virtues I already found, I would hold up to them as far as I can, since hero only die once. therefore I am somehow a strong opinion person. I am self-driven, and autonomous in work. I am a team-player, though skills might need to be polished, as the social value I search for has a huge part based on other people. I am willing to share my expertise with colleagues and at the meanwhile learn from the ones who inspire my respect.

I am Jan, a developer at heart with a big passion for IoT. 
Making devices smarter every day, that's what I do. 

In 2008, I started my journey after I graduated with a master 'Computer Science Engineering' at KU Leuven. 
I started as a developer but soon grew into several managing roles in the IT industry. 

During my career, I noticed a big pain point when working with remote devices. 
I was unable to access my remote devices efficiently and safely. 

To make my life easier, I developed an easy tool to create reverse SSH tunnels. 
I figured more ITers can use this tool, so at this moment Openport was born. 

Fast forward to today, I have 100s of happy customers and reached a milestone of 19 million successful sessions!

"t_2092","I started my career as a field researcher in crop protection. This stimulated me to obtain a PhD in Bioscience Engineering in the context of agricultural biological agents and invasive species. My PhD consisted of biological lab and field research, scientific publications, oral presentations at various (inter)national conferences, collaborations and supervision of thesis students. 

After my PhD I further pursued a research career as Jr. and then Sr. researcher. This was doing more of what I did during my PhD., but with a gradual shift to research about invasive species and to initiating and coordinating several (inter)national research projects. During my research I was introduced to the programming language R, which sparked a gradual integration of computer programming in various aspects of my research activities. 

My new interest in machine learning and computer programming encouraged me to shift to a more prominent data science role. I have worked for a few different companies as had a data scientist. These opportunities have provided me with new and further experiences in machine learning, deep learning algorithms, Python, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, NLP and text mining, recommender systems, building proof of concepts and further automating them, orchestrating and automating end-to-end data-pipelines,  docker and git, MLOPS, dashboarding, data engineering and software programming, collaborating with data scientists and business stakeholders, functioning in an IT operational environment and generally working in an enterprise environment as a data scientist.

"t_2105","I'm a data scientist with 5 years of experience. My biggest passion is to enable anyone to understand and interact with their own health in a P4 way: predictive, personalized, preventative and participatory.

A few things stand out to me: 
1. To go beyond general one-size-fits-all advice, and consider each person's specific make-up.
2. To emphasize longitudinal metrics with actionable feedback to test each person's health.
3. To emphasize preventative medicine, and not only treat symptoms.
4. To empower the user by letting them interact with their data. 

To illustrate this with an example in metabolic health, consider the post-meal blood glucose response. It is very person-specific. Population-based nutrition advice will likely not inform that person's response to different foods well enough. Continuous Glucose Monitors, blood panels and activity data offer metrics that allow to test the response in an interactive way, and put the user in touch with their metabolic health. Integrated in a larger picture with health practitioners, it can change potential health outcomes such as diabetes, obesity, mental well-being, alzheimer, ... Moreover, it brings the scientific mindset closer to the user.

I stand out for:
1. My strong technical adeptness in Mathematics, Statistics and Machine Learning. Years of being exposed to many researchers led to a broad overview as well.
2. My love for learning and combining different skills and fields - from Cognitive Science to Personalized Health, Computational methodology and trek guiding. In the end, Data Science is not the goal for me, but a tool.
3. My ability to work independently. I've independently developed a computational analysis and modelling framework for researchers in Cognitive Psychology for example.
4. My desire for a balanced life and good working relations.

I appreciate collaboration, like to think about how people form connection/community and enjoy learning about health.

"t_2287","I try to contribute to a sustainable and fair world with the aid of science and technology. During my studies in physics, I started thinking about two particular questions: 'Is it possible to create intelligence?', and, 'What happens if we succeed?'. Two questions which led me right into the fast-paced field of artificial intelligence. I feel that ensuring a positive future of artificial intelligence is one of today's most important challenges to address, while at the same time being truly fascinating and engaging from a scientific perspective.

Right now, my research focuses on the emergence of innovation and cooperation in situations where multiple artificial agents learn and interact. I draw inspiration from the process of natural selection, where competition and cooperation have driven the evolution of intelligence for many millions of years, eventually culminating in nature's astonishing diversity and the complexity of our minds.

Besides artificial intelligence, I am also interested in climate change (and using AI to tackle it), cosmology, quantum computing, nuclear fusion and natural movement."

In the last projects, together with a Team, I have shaped new UX flows for clients as Wolt for its b-to-b sector, explored a new business model to innovate a family business in the fishing industry in Finland as well as designed a workshop to find new ways of re-establishing company culture during covid-19 outbreak. (portfolio available on request)

In my career I have worked mostly in the e-commerce sector, being first a Product Analyst in the fashion industry and lately a Product Manager in the tourism business, embracing always customer centricity and the principles of Agile Project Management and Scrum rituals.

In 2011, my paper ""The Business Cycle: A Definition""‚Äã was published in the Spanish academic paper 'Procesos de Mercado'‚Äã (see attachment below). I worked on this paper for many months, and I stand by it as my proof and illustration that the science of economics is meaningless without a fundamental connection to morality and natural law. Neglected as this paper has been so far, I'm proud of it and I think it will withstand the test of time.

My personal life is also tied to Bagaar as I met my wife there. I promised a thousand projects in exchange for her number. A debt I‚Äôm still paying off. Apart from spending time with my family, I love travelling and sports: running, cycling (on the Bagaar team), bikepacking. I find it inspiring to see how people can travel a whole continent using nothing more than their body energy and a bicycle. My next challenge? Bikepacking from Antwerp to the Alps."

"t_2749","In a nutshell I have:
 - Been working as a data scientist for about 1 year at ORTEC Belgium.
 - Did a variety of data science project during my studies.
 - Completed a PhD in computer science (with currently +100 citations).
 - Graduated summa cum laude in Mathematics while doing various data scientific side-jobs.

I am currently working as a data science consultant at ORTEC Belgium. At ORTEC I am working with various clients implementing machine learning and other mathematical methods to solve business problems. For the implementation I use a combination of Python and SQL; projects go from querying the data required to the creation of a User Interface (UI).

During my Phd, I have been using mean field methods to analyze load balancing policies in systems with many servers. My Phd mainly required a lot of probability theory (in particular Markov chain theory), calculus and programming. During my Phd I have come into contact with quite a few optimization and forecasting problems.

I published 9 independent papers (7 as first author). In particular I have been accepted (as first author) for the Sigmetrics Conference three times, this is significant as it is the flagship conference (with an extremely low acceptance rate of ~15%) for my area of research.

In my spare time I do projects to get acquainted with data science, machine learning and operations research. For these side-projects I mainly use Python but also C++ from time to time.

Recently I :
 - Finished the Deep Learning Coursera Specialization
 - Got the first place of the RecoGym Recommender Systems Challenge as part of an AI course I took.
 - Finished the Discrete Optimization course on Coursera, in addition I did quite a few additional projects involving discrete optimization.
 - Solved the fleet assignment problem for an airline company
 - Set up and solved an inland shipping problem for the Flemish Waterways challenge
 - Set up and solved a global shipping problem.
 - Participated in challenges such as Google Code Jam, Google Hash Code and Codeforces."

Born on March 18, 1969, in St. Amandsberg, Belgium. In 1995, Sven Van Poucke graduated ""magna cum laude"" in medicine from the Ghent University. As a student he was passioned by submarine excavations which at that time first required the approval of his parents but rapidly ended up in various underwater projects where his father being shanghaied and his mother used everything in her power to hope for a save return. The ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù environment of submarine excavations and the introduction to a hyperbaric facility convinced Sven Van Poucke that the human physiology exerted by extreme environments would be the first reason to become a medical doctor. Anesthesiology became the discipline which would bring him closer to his initial interest. Van Poucke changed his plans to be nearer to the center of excellence, Le Centre Hyperbare ( Lille (France)) where he was trained to use hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of critically ill patients. During his stay in France, the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium had the ambition to start a hyperbaric facility. The final part of his anesthesiology fellowship and his early years as anesthesiologist, Van Poucke was dedicated, to the development of a facility focusing on the treatment of critical care patients and severe scuba diving accidents. A few years later, Van Poucke had the opportunity to become anesthesiologist at the Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk, Belgium. Sven Van Poucke demonstrated another passion, computational biology, from early in his professional life. Currently, Van Poucke is engaged in various international projects dealing with predictive analytics of medical data. Van Poucke is author of several international scientific papers dealing with analytics and artificial intelligence. Sven Van Poucke, MD, PhD is a regular guest speaker at artificial intelligence conferences around the globe.

With a large focus on Business Administration and Sciences, I practiced analytical thinking and problem-solving using tools like mathematics, statistics, R, and MATLAB. On exchange at IQS School of Management in Barcelona, I enhanced my adaptability to multicultural environments and practiced constructively communicating with different nationalities. Last year, I started a second master's in International Business in San Francisco at HULT International Business School. Here I mainly finessed my work ethic to deal with high workloads and responsibilities in a fast-paced environment. 

In the last two years, I executed five projects in Europe and the USA. With these projects, I helped companies from several industries achieve their growth-oriented goals. I conducted outreach to recruit business partners and acquire prospective customers, but also enhanced customer relations or expanded the customer base by, for example, performing analytical research to answer changing customer needs, performing market research to achieve a product-market fit or even redefining core business activities to increase the reach and impact of the provided service and resources. Furthermore, I also helped companies expand their existing target market by identifying and creating outbound business opportunities. During these projects, I discovered my passion for facilitating companies to achieve their growth-oriented goals as a consultant or representative.

My real strength is my ability to understand what market demands are left unanswered and where a product or service can act as a pain reliever or gain creator‚Äîknowing what the audience wants and connecting it with a product or service with a suitable unique selling proposition. 

As an aspiring Business/Sales Development Representative or Business Consultant, fluent in Dutch and English, as well as conversational in French and Spanish, I am excited to help companies achieve their goals by applying my critical thinking, problem-solving, communication skills, and, last but not least, my resilience. By this means, I hope to positively impact the organization and contribute to the company's mission and create value for its stakeholders. 
Under my current OPT status, I am looking to join companies located in California and active in the FinTech -, Financial Services -, or Software industry.

At last, I approach every opportunity as an investment in myself‚Äîone of which I endeavor to maximize the return."

I love to learn.

At 18 years old, I went to university, and as one of my dear friends describes it, choosing is losing. You cannot study all subjects in the world, so I decided to study the science that describes the world: chemistry. Now that I successfully offended all mathematicians, physicists and biologists, I have to admit that my most enjoyable moments were when all the exact sciences were brought together to come to a solution. The sciences need each other, only then will we be able to tackle the challenges of our time.

I love to work interdisciplinary. 

After obtaining my master‚Äôs degree, I decided to start my professional career as a PhD researcher in an international ‚Ç¨5.5M project. I wanted to broaden my scientific expertise, expand my set of soft skills and work on a big project with a positive impact on society. I learned that I love to employ strategy, intelligence and teamwork to innovate and tackle difficult challenges. I am ambitious and strive to be the best, without bringing others down. I am generous and value interactions with colleagues, friends & collaborators, learning from their expertise and experiences, and vice versa. I want to leave a legacy in the places I go, a legacy where both parties could grow through meaningful communication, mutual respect and shared challenges.

I love to innovate.

In the last 4 years, I‚Äôve transitioned to a tech lead role. Aligning technology with business roadmaps, guiding technical choices, mentoring colleagues, always combined with individual hands-on work. I‚Äôve seen teams create impressive solutions, growing and learning on the way. The joint growth is awesome to see and it is also for me a great place to further learn and develop myself.
 
My goal is to improve efficiency, which sparked my passion for algorithms. Initially triggering me to study software engineering, and to take a master's in operations research. The 5 years thereafter I focused on my software craftsmanship, improving my efficiency. In those years, my focus gradually shifted from creating a customer's solution in maintainable software to solving a customer's problem with machine learning solutions. In the subsequent 5 years, I combined machine learning and data engineering in various ways, for growing datasets.

As one of the first 3 employees of BigData Republic, I co-created the business plan, sales strategy, recruitment, and hiring policies. In the meanwhile, mixing hands-on application of my expertise, and supportive application through coaching, advising, and guiding others. Both internally in BDR and client projects.

I'm now bringing this all together as a senior ML Engineer at Vianai Systems. A place where my interest in causal inference, bandits, uplift, reinforcement learning can be further expanded. And a place where I can apply my engineering skills to combine cutting edge science with actual user facing products.

"t_3292","Momenteel ben ik me aan het verdiepen in de wereld van Data Engineering.

Ik heb bij mijn huidige werkgever ontzettend veel geluk gehad. Als een persoon wiens werkervaring in maanden te tellen was, kreeg ik de uitzonderlijke kans om mee te helpen met het ontwikkelen van een cloud omgeving. Dat is elke dag een uitdaging, en vereist de nodige dosis koppigheid en nieuwsgierigheid, twee eigenschappen die ik gelukkig in ruime mate bezit.

De cloud is een omgeving die altijd in ontwikkeling is. Er zijn altijd wel veranderingen die mijn werk beinvloeden. Gelukkig is agile een manier van werken die me precies de handvatten geeft om hier mee om te gaan. Mijn team werkt DevOps, wat aansluit bij mijn eigen mindset: ik ben verantwoordelijk voor de dingen die ik bouw.

Ik ben een tijd lang geinteresseerd geweest in het doorgroeien naar een Data Scientist rol. Ik vergelijk Data Scientist en Data Engineering altijd met de studies die ik gevolgd heb: Natuurkunde en Wiskunde (respectievelijk). De laatste is zo precies als je het maken kan, en de eerste is gedwongen om zich te vormen naar een complexe realiteit. Beide vakgebieden zijn zeer interessant (en hebben veel overlap), maar mijn huidige interesses neigen momenteel naar de exactere kant: data engineering.

Mijn werk is belangrijk voor me. Voor mij is het niet iets wat ik doe 8 uur per dag, het is iets dat aan moet sluiten bij mijn persoonlijkheid. Het moet me de kans geven om mijn analytisch denkvermogen en logisch redeneren los te laten op problemen. Ik moet de kans krijgen om nieuwe dingen te leren en die kennis te delen. Zolang mijn werk me dat bied, kom ik elke dag met plezier."
"t_3293","[english version below]

Ik hou van data. 
De beloftes, de onmogelijkheden, de verhalen en de uitdagingen.
Maar het mooiste vind ik om mensen en bedrijven te helpen met die beloftes en uitdagingen, en ze echt verder te helpen.

Soms zit ik daarvoor zelf in de data en bouw ik modellen, datapipelines, soms creer en implementeer ik AI modellen en soms werk ik op strategisch niveau samen om plannen en programma's vorm te geven met betrekking tot data. Uiteindelijk allemaal om mensen, data en bedrijven die met data werken een stapje verder te helpen.

Wat dat betreft ben ik een echte generalist, met brede ervaring, en zit ik het liefst half tijd in python te bouwen, om vervolgens de rest van de week workshops te geven, stakeholders te enthousiasmeren en mijn data collega's te coachen en ze verder te helpen met het maken van mooie oplossingen.

De belangrijkste eigenschappen die ik daarbij meebreng zijn humor, communicatie en een sterk analytisch vermogen. Graag geef ik richting waar nodig en ik ben informeel in de omgang.

-----------------------------

I love data.
It's promises, impossiblities, hidden stories and challenges that it brings.
But most of all, I love to help people and businesses realise these promises and challenges, to work with them for their next data step.

Sometimes I'm building and modeling in pythons, and setting up datapipelines, or building and implementing models, and sometimes it means collaborating on a strategic level to shape plans and programs regarding data driven working. In the end it's all for the same cause. To help people, data and companies working with data to make the next step.

I guess that makes me a data science generalist, with broad experience. Preferably I spend half my time in python and the other half helping people, manage stakeholders and coach data collegue's with creating fancy new solutions.

The qualities that shape me and my work the most are: humor, communication and a strong analytic capacity. I'll gladly give direction if needed and consider myself as informal in the workspace."

"t_3345","I am first and foremost a problem solver and have developed a love for those surrounding prediction. Utilizing first principles from my physics background, I approach machine learning with the same frame of mind. My start in data science began with building machine learning algorithms to beat NBA Player Prop markets while simultaneously competing in machine learning contests on Kaggle. 

After graduating from university, I joined FanDuel's Sports Modeling and Innovation Team. Over the past three years, I have worked on all the major sports, using statistical learning (from the most elementary to machine learning models) to forecast weather, player props, main markets, and more. This work has involved taking ideas that started as research and development operations to fully automated and ""productionized"" frameworks with graphical interfaces in Chartio and Tableau.

As a quant in the sports betting industry, the efficacy and performance of the predictions are paramount. As a result, I've acquired vast experience building models focusing on producing generalizable results with superior accuracy. As with all models, the most important goals are that of the model stakeholders; often, this involves a balance between model complexity and interpretability. As a machine learning practitioner, I strive to understand and define the ultimate goals first and then execute and explain the solution to those with less technical backgrounds."

My (academic) career started as a bachelor student Communication- and Information Science at the Utrecht University. During the second year of the bachelor I followed the digital communications track which included the ‚ÄòDigital Data Analysis‚Äô course. After this course it became clear to me: I want to become a data scientist. Having the possibility to work in different domains while still having an expertise was what spoke to me the most. 

I completed the minor information sciences where I learned to program (C# and R) and perform data analysis. At the same time I increased my data skills at the Utrecht Data School by leading a team and working for Radiuz by developing a dashboard for their company. My bachelor thesis was data related as well by writing about bias in training datasets for facial recognition based on the phenotypes of the persons in the pictures (grade: 8.5).

After completing my bachelor‚Äôs I went to do the Data Science and Society master (MSc) at the Tilburg University. Here, I primarily focused on (advanced) programming in Python, machine learning and deep learning. I applied that expertise with great fun during my thesis by using deep learning and machine learning techniques to quantify features of cells (imaged by phase contrast microscopes) at Mimetas (grade: 8).

Recently graduated from Utrecht University in a MSc Applied Data Science, joining Bright Cape's Analytics and Applied Data Science team to utilize the (programming) skills and insights learned during my masters. While also bringing in my analytical skills and critical thinking I learned while studying Life Sciences and Biotechnology. 

To give a bit of a more personal background, I first started out in a technical degree of Biotechnology and after that a bachelor in Life Sciences. During these years I discovered my aptitude- and taste for tackling problems which I came across. One of those problems was the improper usage of data within laboratories and the inefficient data wrangling, this led to me taking on a Data Science masters to properly handle and analyze data. 

Programming languages used: MySQL, Python and R."

This never left me, as building software systems to solve needs around me quickly became one of my favourite things to do. After moving from Costa Rica to Europe for my Master‚Äôs studies, I dove deeper into just how fascinating machine learning systems can be. My PhD in automatic analysis of real-life social behavior gave me the opportunity to identify and work on both relevant research questions and relevant engineering needs. A good part of my work has dealth with understanding the nuances in annotation of human behavior, how annotation impacts model performance, and developing and validating new, more efficient systems for the annotation of human behavior."

"t_3465","Hello, my name is Lorenzo. I was born and raised in Italy, and went to university at Polytechnic of Milan where I got my Batchelor's Degree in Automation Engineering. 
In 2020, I decided to make another step forward and move to the north of Europe, more precisely to the Netherlands. My background in engineering gave me a strong academic basis that allowed me to be accepted at Utrecht University. Here, after two edifying (and not so easy) years, I earned my Master's Degree in Human-Computer Interaction. My goal during that time was to study and implement intelligent agents augmented with the latest Machine Learning techniques. 

I have a discrete experience in Matlab and C due to my background as an Automation Engineer and extensive practice with R for statistical analysis of data. My core programming language is Python where throughout the years I have refined my skills in computational linguistics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning techniques with libraries such as SpaCy, nltk, OpenCV, and gym. Additionally, I am proficient with PyTorch as a framework for the implementation of on-device Machine Learning models.

I would like to be part of a dynamic and international environment. I am eager to learn, totally open to discussion, and willing to travel for business.

I like to keep myself updated on the latest advances in the field of AI, and as a strong believer in deliberate practice, I like to occasionally experiment with some of these technologies. For past coding works and small personal projects check out my GitHub profile (https://github.com/LorenzoPozzi97). 
Another passion of mine is writing. I regularly write to keep track of what I did and decide where I am going. I also have a blog page on Medium (https://medium.com/@Lorenzo_Pozzi) where from time to time I write articles about AI-related topics that I find particularly interesting. 
Other than this, I delight in playing (very amateurishly) chess and reading as much as I can. I am also very fond of sports, role-playing games, good weather, and hiking."

"t_3484","At the age of 16, with one year left to get my math high school diploma;  I dropped out of school since I thought I wasn‚Äôt learning as much as I should. As a top student, this decision was accepted neither by my parents nor by school. Two months later, I had to go back to school to calm down my panicked parents who made life very difficult for me. At this point, I was a young girl; a bookworm and thinker who just couldn't accept inequalities in society and the suppression of individuality and creativity by the school. A Holden Caulfield in Iran. 

A few years later, I was a sociology student, researcher, and blogger trying to make a difference. Through working on a couple of social sciences projects in Iran, I tried to understand the lived experience of different groups of society such as people diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder, addicted women, sex workers, and disabled children. I used statistics, SPSS, interviews, and focus groups in my work.  Whether it was analyzing numbers or words, I was not the same person as when I stepped into their world after each of these experiences. The new me was more sympathetic and kind but at the same time firm to raise their voice. 

Meanwhile, I was working as a tour guide in Isfahan, my truly beautiful hometown. Where I learned how to be a good storyteller and how to present a (stereotypical) culture to people with different backgrounds and cultures in a short time.  These experiences have helped me become a good communicator.

I was always fascinated by hypothesis making and testing since my first statistics class and throughout my working life as a researcher, and this passion led me to the field of data science in 2020. I completed Le Wagon‚Äôs data science boot camp and Applied Data Science master's program from Utrecht University. I am currently looking for opportunities in this field. I thrive when my work has a societal impact.

I used supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, as well as data visualization techniques, to present the results of my projects. I am good at explaining complex technical concepts to people with no or limited technical knowledge. I am an analytical thinker who enjoys learning new things and using new tools and frameworks. 

Aside from data science, I enjoy reading world literature, running, and experimenting in the kitchen! 

I stay positive and proactive whatever the situation is. This is a lesson I learned from long-distance running. If you just keep going, you will reach your destiny."

Door deze nieuwe interesse ben ik verder gegaan met mijn studie door een Computer Science master te volgen met een specialisatie in data analyse. Deze studie heeft mijn interesse in het data science vakgebied bevestigd. Ik heb veel geleerd over AI en machine learning."

Ik hou van data. 
De beloftes, de onmogelijkheden, de verhalen en de uitdagingen.
Maar het mooiste vind ik om mensen en bedrijven te helpen met die beloftes en uitdagingen, en ze echt verder te helpen.

Soms zit ik daarvoor zelf in de data en bouw ik modellen, datapipelines, soms creer en implementeer ik AI modellen en soms werk ik op strategisch niveau samen om plannen en programma's vorm te geven met betrekking tot data. Uiteindelijk allemaal om mensen, data en bedrijven die met data werken een stapje verder te helpen.

Wat dat betreft ben ik een echte generalist, met brede ervaring, en zit ik het liefst half tijd in python te bouwen, om vervolgens de rest van de week workshops te geven, stakeholders te enthousiasmeren en mijn data collega's te coachen en ze verder te helpen met het maken van mooie oplossingen.

De belangrijkste eigenschappen die ik daarbij meebreng zijn humor, communicatie en een sterk analytisch vermogen. Graag geef ik richting waar nodig en ik ben informeel in de omgang.

I love data.
It's promises, impossiblities, hidden stories and challenges that it brings.
But most of all, I love to help people and businesses realise these promises and challenges, to work with them for their next data step.

Sometimes I'm building and modeling in pythons, and setting up datapipelines, or building and implementing models, and sometimes it means collaborating on a strategic level to shape plans and programs regarding data driven working. In the end it's all for the same cause. To help people, data and companies working with data to make the next step.

I guess that makes me a data science generalist, with broad experience. Preferably I spend half my time in python and the other half helping people, manage stakeholders and coach data collegue's with creating fancy new solutions.

The qualities that shape me and my work the most are: humor, communication and a strong analytic capacity. I'll gladly give direction if needed and consider myself as informal in the workspace."

"t_3718","Ever since I was a little boy, I've always liked languages and been attracted by technology. I started my university journey with a BA in Mandarin and linguistics. These studies let me widen my perspective over the human faculty of language, and that's when my love for languages deepened. I concluded my BA with a dissertation in historical linguistics talking about things you've never heard of.

After graduating, I had the opportunity to join Samsung to work in the localization project of the Bixby vocal assistant: I grabbed it in no time! It was a golden opportunity to explore a field that I had no idea existed. As soon as I started, I just couldn't get enough. I understood that computational linguistics was the right path for me to follow.

I yearned to learn more about the interactions that natural languages and computers can have. This brought me to start an MSc in NLP. The most outstanding achievement during these studies was publishing a paper at TALN 2021. I also had the chance to work as a researcher at ATILF and Inria labs. In my MSc thesis, I developed a system to help students and professors learn and teach languages.

This whole journey brought me to fall in love with research. I'm now a PhD researcher in Utrecht in the NL4XAI project framework, partly funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program under the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie grant. I'm working on automatically generating optimally intelligible text for humans, starting from obscure semantic formulae.

When I'm not teaching computers how to speak, I love doing sports and traveling. Discovering the marvelous things the planet we live on can offer us fuels my life. I'm a curious person, always eager to learn new things, and ready to accept new challenges to prove myself and improve as a human being."

My latest industrial endevours revolve around the specification and realisation of software system architectures that are based on the concept of code generation, both through the usage of advanced templating technologies offered by higher level scripting languages (such as python) as well as stand alone mechanisms of model driven code generation (i.e. enhancing the spectrum of compiler technology by means of meta generating existent programming languages, rather than developing advanced compiler science).

I still view Gaming Technology as the best means of applying my Software Architecture skills, so one day I will probably return to the Entertainment sphere."

I bring experience in corporate organizations, business analytics, and knowledge in a variety of rising sectors to the table. I am currently seeking a position in consultancy or analyst roles with extensive elements of digital transformation and innovation.

My interests revolve around making an impact that matters. That is why I started BioCafe, my BioTech startup where we work on producing sustainable solutions and alternatives to Spent Coffee Grounds (SCG).

"t_3911","I've had a connection with computers as long as i can remember. Growing up in my parents house we had four PC's on a LAN network so my dad could defeat me and my brother (and any friends staying over) playing Age of Empires 2. 

In high school I recall trying to get my programs on other people's home PC's through MSN messenger so I could flip their screens upside-down and feel like a hacker.

While being a broke college student I programmed a Raspberry-Pi to serve as a media center using my PC as a storage device over the network. It took three full days but boy was i proud!

While working in education I've taught myself through online courses and YouTube tutorials how to code in Python and Java. After taking the step to IT through the traineeship offered by Calco I've learned about Agile, Scrum, ITIL processes, ERD, Cloud, SQL and PowerShell. Working for NNIP I've become more proficient at SQL and Python, learned about AWS, VBA, Alteryx, Denodo, API's, PowerCenter, PowerBI and to care less about the tool and more about the solution. In my spare time I'm learning about Data Science through an IBM course hosted on EdX using Python and IBM cloud.

My international academic studies gave me multiple perspectives on the environment, especially those of cities. The Urban Planning Bachelor‚Äôs studies at the University of Rome gave me the foundations to answer why and how cities evolve and how I could steer their evolution for the better. During the Geo Science master's at the University of Utrecht, I applied innovative methods and technologies to develop simple solutions and tackle complex real-world problems.

In my final essay, I researched and implemented a methodology to automate the spatio-temporal and semantic detection of urban hotspots where people tend to crowd, through a combination of Twitter events and Intent Detection. In short, I computed a heatmap of geo-located events to detect crowded areas and then I applied semi-supervised machine learning on the text data of the Twitter events to detect the user‚Äôs intention.

Through my international experience at Here Technologies, in The Netherlands and Germany, I have developed skills in the areas of data and software engineering. I have developed automated data extraction and data processing techniques using agile methodologies. Currently, I am developing myself further towards a product management role with daily cross-functional and cross-team collaborations to address user-centric issues and ensuring common deadlines.

"t_3971","I am a philosopher, writer, practitioner and teacher with a deep compassion for the human condition and a burning desire to help people live better lives, do better work and create a more sustainable and socially connected society in the process. Those may be lofty goals and sound somewhat unobtainable, but I have a uniquely pragmatic approach to these challenges. I break complex concepts down into simple, compelling and powerful stories, frameworks and models. My keynotes and workshops give people practical tools and ways to take control of their own development. And my very personal style, sprinkled with humour, anecdotes and pearls of wisdom, engage and motivate audiences to see beyond the obvious and the limited, into a future in which anything is possible.

I have spent my whole life trying to understand what makes us humans tick. Even though I worked most of my professional career in the IT industry, I have always approached everything from the human angle: how does it make us feel, why do we behave in this way, how do we decide, how do we change - or don‚Äôt? Introduced by my late wife Michal Levit to the field of Emotional Intelligence, I have explored the idea of the emotionally mature workplace and how to achieve that. Throughout 30+ years of working with organisations all over the planet I have helped individuals and organisations with maturing their awareness and mastery of their individual and collective emotional abilities; creating more inspiring and sustainable approaches to leadership and team development; and taking responsibility for the future evolution of their organisational cultures.

I don't just talk about these things, I can coach, mentor and facilitate workshops and off-sites for individuals, teams and even whole organisations. I always tailors my keynotes, workshops and off-sites to the needs of my clients, combining material from my extensive library of topics and modules with fresh material in new and effective ways."

Those may be lofty goals and sound somewhat unobtainable, but I have a uniquely pragmatic approach to these challenges. I break complex concepts down into simple, compelling and powerful stories, frameworks and models. My keynotes and workshops give people practical tools and ways to take control of their own development. And my very personal style, sprinkled with humour, anecdotes and pearls of wisdom, engage and motivate audiences to see beyond the obvious and the limited, into a future in which anything is possible.

I have spent my whole life trying to understand what makes us humans tick. Even though I worked most of my professional career in the IT industry, I have always approached everything from the human angle: how does it make us feel, why do we behave in this way, how do we decide, how do we change - or don‚Äôt? Introduced by my late wife Michal Levit to the field of Emotional Intelligence, I have explored the idea of the emotionally mature workplace and how to achieve that. Throughout 30+ years of working with organisations all over the planet I have helped individuals and organisations with maturing their awareness and mastery of their individual and collective emotional abilities; creating more inspiring and sustainable approaches to leadership and team development; and taking responsibility for the future evolution of their organisational cultures.

I don't just talk about these things, I can coach, mentor and facilitate workshops and off-sites for individuals, teams and even whole organisations.

My research interests lie in creating AR experiences and new forms of natural interaction with hands and objects in 3D, particularly in everyday environments with augmented reality (AR). My strength lies in the ability to understand and combine complex technologies across the full stack, from sensors and optical systems to GPU-accelerated ML and vision processing, 3D graphics, and gesture recognition to the user interface. I lead cross-functional teams for rapid prototyping of vertically integrated real-time systems that help proof out novel technical contributions or use case scenarios, unblock prototyping on the user-facing side, and identify issues in the backend early on. My background in human-computer interaction allows me to carefully consider human factors, user needs, and usability issues while designing new user interaction techniques or defining technical specifications (e.g. latency, ergonomics, etc.).

At Google, I was a Technical Lead for R&D projects in the area of AR systems and input devices. I led rapid prototyping of immersive mixed reality experiences with 3D graphics, GPGPU, ML, vision, and hardware. I led and shipped ARCore Depth Lab, led and internally shipped AR prototyping systems., drove the evaluation of the human perception of passthrough AR optics and explored the solution space, and initiated and co-led a new input device workstream for AR.

Before joining Google, I was a founding team member and Senior Technology Scientist at Perceptive IO, which got acquired by Google. Before that, I worked on freeform 3D interaction technology as a Researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond and in Cambridge UK.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computing Science from Newcastle University UK and a Diplom (MSc) in Media Informatics from Ludwig-Maximilian-University (LMU) in Munich Germany.

"t_4455","""Data Science"" wasn't a thing when I started my BA in Economics (& Middle Eastern studies), but I was always drawn to the idea of extracting meaningful insights about human behavior from data and models.

Throughout my career, I have always been interested in both artificial and biological systems; how such systems can extract, represent and manipulate informational structures to perform complex cognitive functions. My interest into complex cognitive systems began as an undergraduate at the ‚ÄúRoma Tre‚Äù university of Rome where I completed my studies in philosophy with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life approaches to Cognitive Sciences. Afterwards I decided to focus on the domains of human memory and reasoning by pursuing a PhD at the university of Amsterdam. During this time, I used experimental and statistical approaches to study the computational underpinnings of human risky decision making and memory processing; how is information encoded, retrieved and used to guide behavioral decisions. Then, as a postdoctoral researcher at the Radboud university of Nijmegen, I delved deeper into the human brain using a combination of statistical modeling and neuroimaging techniques to look at how abstract conceptual information is represented and processed, specifically in relation to language. Later on, I moved to the start-up ecosystem working for a time as a consultant. During this period I worked on developing AI systems for distributed ledger technologies in collaboration with Helix Cognitive Computing and on developing adaptive learning algorithms for the LetterPrins app in collaboration with Esther Steenbeek-Planting and the Language in Interaction Consortium."

"t_4510","I am a entrepreneur, inventor and software engineer who is passionate about changing the world for the better by making robotics automation more widely accessible. I truly believe that improving the access and usability of robots can help people and businesses grow in previously unattainable ways.  

Currently, I lead a cross-functional product team at X to build a robot SDK to make it easier and cheaper to apply robots in industrial manufacturing. Over my career, I worked both on developing cutting-edge approaches in academia as well as building easy-to-use, intuitive products that generate genuine customer value.

For example, at TUM I developed a 3D reconstruction algorithm that allows to scan a person in 3D and print the acquired model as a small figure. To bring this technology to market, I co-founded the 3D scanning startup FabliTec in 2013 and served there as the CEO until 2015. Together with my team, I worked since 2014 at Metaio on efficient algorithms for inertial-inertial odometry, 3D reconstruction and face tracking for augmented reality applications. During my time there, we showcased our work successfully at various high-impact events which contributed significantly to the acquisition of Metaio in May 2015 by Apple. I joined Google's Project Tango/ArCore to make 3D reconstruction and semantic understanding a commodity for Android. 

My particular strength is that I am both an excellent hands-on programmer and a successful team leader. I am good at motivating my team members and colleagues to work on challenging problems and at guiding these projects to success.

I hold a BSc (2003) and MSc (2006) degree in computer science from the University of Amsterdam.   I obtained my PhD in robotics in 2011 under the supervision of Prof. Wolfram Burgard at the University of Freiburg and worked afterwards as a post-doctoral researcher in the computer vision lab of Prof. Daniel Cremers at the Technical University of Munich. I am listed as the world's 2nd most influential scholar in robotics (https://www.aminer.org/ai2000/robotics), measured by the number of citations at top venues (ICRA and IROS) over the past 10 years."

Being a sportsperson, I have learned some valuable lessons which have definitely helped me in my academic and professional life. Tackling everyday problems have become easier with my never give up attitude and failures have become constant learning experiences. I understand the worth of determination and hard work and there is no substitute for that.  But to cut the long story short, my childhood passions have turned into hobbies and hobbies into passion. 

I believe my passion for analyzing and playing with data began with my first job as a Junior Bioinformatics Associate at Ganit Labs after completing my bachelors where I was tasked with handling and automating big data analysis.

I decided to pursuit masters in the same field of bioinformatics focusing on specific data science courses after working for couple of years. I have also been part of some data mining and machine learning projects during my first year of masters. 

In my second year, I interned with the Biosystem data analysis group at the University of Amsterdam where I worked on classification algorithms to discriminate between different groups of samples of healthy individuals and patients by using simulations and real data. I developed my technical skills even further working at Shell as a data science intern tackling real world business problems of automating,predicting and classifying IT related issues of the employees.

All of this has led me to my current role as a Data Analyst at Newzoo.

You would probably find me dancing, exercising, watching football or socialising with my friends if I am not sitting in front of a computer screen.

If you are interested to know more about my passions, feel free to contact me. I would be happy to answer all your questions.

During my life in Romania (born as Hungarian in Transylvania, with some English roots), I've noticed that I can do and want to do more than the way was paved for me from the first day of my life. Trying my best to broke those chains, I got to develop more ambition, discipline and a strong will to do what I like, should and want to do, to accomplish something and to help other ones too.

I couldn't go far enough in my own country so I came to West to work and to learn new cultures and new mentalities, to come to understanding and love the differences of cultures which opened my eyes. Through these I‚Äôve learned more about my own culture and country as well. That made me hungrier for more learning, so I started again to study at the university. 

Currently following a bachelor in software development at IU Germany. Previously, Open University gave me the chance to study psychology with minors in culture, art and informatica (and to combine a full-time work with study).

I want to specialize myself in strategic communication needed for crisis situations, bridging differences and misunderstandings in different cultures, human mentality and AI, programming and to fight against human and animal trafficking, management and recruitment, forensics and missing persons.
I am trying to build up a bridge between cultures (Hungarian, Romanian, English and Dutch) through my work, communication with people, organizations and through my studies.
I've started also to code, interested in AI, science and technology, web design, sports and I am an avid reader, love animals and travelling."

What I am looking for

Not searching for a job, but I know people that are. Also searching for projects that need knowledge, guidance or financing, I can help out. 

What I am doing now

In my free time I am doing BJJ, Judo, Jijitsu and kickboxing. No heavy hits on my head obviously. I like to connect people.  However, I find integrity very important. But my curiosity brings me in interesting places :)

"t_4759","I always loved Computer Science, from simple algorithms to software development, testing, and optimization. This is the reason why I decided to pursue a career in the Computer Science field, starting from a bachelor degree in that field. During that period, along with liking what I was doing, I discovered what AI was, and I became fascinated. Started watching every video I could find on the argument, got intrigued learning every new concept and started playing with simple projects. That was the moment in which I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I finished my degree earlier to get into the University of Amsterdam master in AI, and since then I tried to absorb everything that I was coming in contact and that was related to AI. There I discovered the real capabilities of what I was learning and enjoyed every minute of my classes.

The enjoyment for what I do from my AI master, coupled with my care for details from my CS bachelor, allowed me to work in what I consider the best workplaces where I lived. Solving problems during internships or developing concrete products in the later occupations, I have always been able to reach the given objectives, with punctuality and professionality.

I now consider myself to have a strong understanding of various areas of my daily job, such as:
Python and Java for software design, along with good knowledge of C++, C#, and C
Keras, SciPy, NumPy, Jupyter, etc. for Machine Learning and numerical computations
Google Colab and DigitalOcean for cloud computing
Various CI/CD tools, as well as strong knowledge of git and various databases
along with good knowledge of Docker virtualization and networking

I am also starting to develop web UIs to interface my backends, using React, Node, NGINX, and similar technologies, and I'm always trying to add more into my repertoire of skills, no matter what their field of application is.¬†"

Mission
My goal is to be able to leverage AI, specifically ML and DL to solve real-world problems. But, I don't want to focus only on myself for doing that. Jack Welch said, ‚ÄúBefore you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.‚Äù Therefore, I find it important to grow myself and also help others grow as well so that we can collectively better prepare ourselves and work together to address whatever problems lie ahead.

What‚Äôs next?
As Aristotle said, ‚ÄúFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them‚Äù. Thus, as a highly motivated person, able to adapt, learn, evolve and help other people grow, I am always interested in taking on new opportunities and challenges to learn and contribute."

Since finishing my PhD I have designed software for both instrument control and data analysis for various ground- and space based astronomical instruments (mainly for the European Southern Observatory and the Herschel Space Observatory). Thereby I obtained experience in all stages of software development from collecting the requirements, making a design until developing, testing and integrating the software in a production environment. Furthermore, my scientific background helps me to understand many data analysis problems and to find or create the appropriate algorithms to handle them, or to develop user interfaces which give scientist a better insight in the data.

The projects I worked on had very different technological requirements, so that I am familiar with many different programming languages from C/C++ to Java and Python and techniques from near real time analysis to handling very large amounts of data and parallel programming. I also am used to quickly adapt to new environments and learn new technologies like web application frameworks. I am currently very enthusiastic about Scala and its tools and frameworks like Play. My first couple of months of working with this language already improved my productivity a lot compared to Java programming. 

Currently I want to apply my skills much more broadly and would like to contribute to projects for daily life software which need a lot of data collection, organisation, processing, analysis and feedback.

"t_5230","ML often involves making many smaller decisions quickly, statistics often involves making fewer bigger decisions with controlled risk. I have worked both on large scale sub 100 ms and on modeling multi-billion  planning decisions.
 
For ML products I aim for AI portfolio cohesion. The most profitable systems are created by first understanding first the business model, then the function the business performs, then the technical systems involved in that function, and lastly the data generated by these technical systems.  This overview allows one to identify and  communicate customer journeys, and to see what data is present or needs to be acquired.

Statistical analysis for me shines when estimating decision risk using utilities based posterior predictive distributions. Ideally this would start out with the elicitation of expert opinions, creating a generative Bayesian model and assigning utilities. This setup extends Monte Carlo simulations by allowing for both expert uncertainty, and the possibility to manage this uncertainty by adding data.

I developed the final design of the system which was to use convolutional filtering and short term trend forecasting to treat the stores as individuals choosing items in an attempt to cluster them. The system beat several competitors in an internal competition with the client and was considered comparable to the human team that managed replenishment. I also designed and negotiated for the experiment that would test our system before final deployment. The test would require using 206 stores and over ‚Ç¨5 million euro worth of stock being under the systems control. The trust we built with the client over time and my work to explain the technical reasons for this saw them willingly agree to this large request and the test ran for 3 months. 

- I built a contextual bandit system to control push notifications that would be sent to users. The system tried to optimise the notifications sent to users to maximise the probability of them logging into their account. I was the exclusive project contributor, managing the design, testing of python packages that would operate the bandit (a type of recommender), designing the SQL schemes and tables in MySQL. Further I coded all parts of the ETL, ML training and recommendation of notifications. These recommendations would then be sent to a pre-existing api to send notifications to users.

- Churn modelling and retention modelling using direct time series forecasting with a collection of models. The goal being to provide warnings about when a customer is loosing interest in the product so that the company can act."

"t_5424","In short: A very curious person who likes solving problems and mathematics. 

That's why I studied physics and later spent ~10 years in Academia unraveling the mysteries of our Universe as a Researcher in Theoretical Physics. Throughout this period I had the privilege of working at world leading research facilities, collaborating with brilliant  research scientists, giving multiple seminars and talks at international conferences, and addressing questions about the beginning of the Universe or why the expansion rate of the Universe is growing.

I eventually changed fields in order to work on a more applicable discipline. That's why I choose Data Science / Artificial Intelligence. Physics and Data Science may look very different from the outside, but they actually share a lot: the ultimate goal in both cases is solving problems using mathematics, and the methodologies used are often very similar. These similarities made the transition between fields smooth, and the knowledge acquired as a researcher (analytical, organisation, teamwork and communication skills) quickly proved very useful. The main difference is thus the type of issues addressed: I now encounter more 'down to earth' problems and in turn I know that my work will soon have an impact :)

I graduated from the ""Statistical science for the life and behavioural sciences"" Master's program at Leiden University.

"t_5738","Ever since I first learned about how far we have made it in transforming large bulks of data into meaningful knowledge for the world, I knew that I wanted to be part of that transformation to create something even better for everyone. 

As my bioinformatics and data science skills have grown during my journey, I have become more and more determined to use my knowledge to contribute to a better world. 

In my first internship in a professional setting, I used my knowledge of noSQL databases to design a storage system for large plant datasets and worked to design a web-based interface to enable quick searches through this data.

While I loved working with plants, a great opportunity opened up during my master‚Äôs degree to learn how to apply my skills to cancer data. In this project, I collaborated with a research team to develop a novel computational algorithm in Python & R that can reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer growth.  

I then deepened my research into the field of medicine during my PhD, where I developed and optimized algorithms, including a lot of machine learning, in Python to predict previously uncharacterized mechanisms by which cancer may develop. This task involved collection, integration and annotation of big, heterogeneous biological and medical datasets.  

One of my favorite tasks has been to share my exciting research findings with the world through presentations to various audiences, including people without a background in informatics. 

Currently, I wish to further expand my professional career in an opportunity where I can put my data science and machine learning skills to work while creating a better world."

To understand and properly set up the communication tools plays a key role in the proper functioning of an organization. Technical skills play an important role in that, but programming and the ability to use software are not sufficient to build a system for engineering maintenance, project planning or logistics. Doing so requires various competences, including technical and human communication, setting up guidelines and manuals, and understanding of organizational structure and even the legal impact of regulations such as privacy and anti-corruption laws. Without the proper knowledge of the distinct fields, one cannot set up a system from which the necessary information can be extracted to be properly analyzed.

A thorough understanding of project planning and project control plays a key role in completing the missing link between most operational tools. Without it, one cannot establish a proper and complete exchange of information between financial, logistic, engineering and planning tools.

"t_5908","Greetings!

I am a Data Analyst with one year of professional experience in Power BI and SQL. I am also acquainted with Python and R. 

I redirected my career towards Data Analysis and Data Science because I wanted a change to an area that instigates my intellect and curiosity, gives more geographical freedom, and will be even more relevant in years to come.

In connection with this change, I moved to the Netherlands (a country where I didn‚Äôt know anyone) by myself at the height of the COVID pandemic. This move was quite a lesson in adaptability, resilience, problem-solving, and communication, and also challenged me to be more direct, independent, and self-sufficient. 

I have been dedicating myself to getting more fluent in Python and in machine learning algorithms. I aim to enrich my analysis and dabbling into predictions, employing more programming and statistics in my work. I am willing to deepen my knowledge however necessary, and I  pick up skills and adapt to new routines quickly. I have a lifelong learner disposition, and I am also aware that it is important to be able to use whatever tool at our disposal to solve the problems we have at hand.

For over a decade, I have worked for the Brazilian government as a civil servant in the fields of justice, transportation, and banking. I am experienced with analytical work, and I am proud to say that during those years, I have earned the trust, respect, and even the friendship of my coworkers and superiors. 

The most important thing that I learned in the Brazilian civil service is to do the best work possible, even when resources and working conditions are subpar. That requires disposition and a good dose of creativity in solving problems. I have always strived to provide the best possible service to the citizens, and this translates well also to satisfying stakeholders and customers.

"t_6049","Hi, I am Vincent and rational and irrational decision making is what intrigues me. If a user of a product walks through a user journey, where are the critical points where their decision is influenced? And if we located these points, do we know if it‚Äôs conscious or unconscious decision? What job does the user actually want to get done? Based on that and other factors, how are we able to transform the decision in a desired one? 

Data tells us a lot, whether it is quantitative or qualitative data, it helps us finding important (pain) points and helps us coming up with great techniques to influence behavior. By conducting both qualitative and quantitative (user) research and combining this with my knowledge of (social/consumer) psychology I can help out commercial and non-commercial companies by helping users make the desired decision.

I am originally a mathematician. Programming did not have my interest in the early days of my education, but I got more excited when I learned that I could write my calculations in code. At this point in time, data science caught my attention and that did got me hooked on programming. First in R, but that changed rather quickly into Python. It is fair to say that I have over six years experience in Python and since I began programming, more and more other languages and purposes got my attention. Learning by doing suits me best and next to my machine learning experience, that is how I learned about building pipelines, infrastructure, backends and web/app development.

Through shared experiences, technological innovation and a willingness to walk the path less trodden, my clients learn to innovate from a more creative connection to the unknown: Complexity and Change are friends for those that are willing to step into the unknown.

As a technologist and data scientist, I have a background in cosmology, with deep roots in image processing , machine learning and artificial intelligence. Technology and its societal impact fascinate me. My scientific and technological skills have allowed me to develop innovative applications using machine learning and data processing algorithms in domains such as: 
Neuroscience & Physiology, 
Traffic Information,
Cellular Communication Networks, 
Oil Exploration, 
3D Imaging & Remote Sensing, 
Astronomy.

My life experience, deep scientific knowledge and training as a body-oriented coach have enabled me to provide guidance to both individual CEO‚Äôs and organisations such Google, Rockstart and HAS University of applied sciences. Resulting in increased stress resilience, innovative thinking and embodied wellbeing. 

My role within the Dutch Institute for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), grew from an enthusiasm to develop a strategy and vision for alleviating modern societal problems using data driven systems and demonstrated the feasibility of these concepts in functional prototypes, government reports and public pilots. I was responsible for the development of new systems and products for traffic information, user services and traffic management.  Advising the government based on both realtime and historical statistical analysis. Within this role I build small team of scientists and developers, doubling the departments revenue. We developed and maintained a multiyear innovation roadmap with a 500k-2M euro/year project revenue, creating mobile applications, back-office services and strategic analysis for both industry and government.

Recognising the importance of exploring my personal limits and new environments, I embarked on a entrepreneurial mission to empower other leaders and game-changers in their ability to innovate and now look forward to bring this knowledge on peak human performance and technological innovation into larger organisations by thinking outside the box, leading and inspiring others with vision and enthusiasm and applying my experience to  provide technical leadership to complex, multidisciplinary teams."

"t_6216","I am an enthusiastic Data Engineer with great communication skills and a strong drive to learn. As data engineer, I help companies to reap the benefits of data and machine learning. This can be by developing and deploying data products or by functioning as a translator between developers, data scientists and the business.

While working as data scientist in the beginning of my career, I experienced still too many data science proof-of-concept projects (PoC) never deliver business value. Even though they might have a strong business case and promising results, closing the gap between a POC and a successful data science product is difficult. Very difficult. As such, I altered my career path from being a data scientist to becoming a data engineer and made it my mission to help companies in pursuit of this ambitious and challenging goal: productionization of data.

I get energy from solving complex problems with interesting new technologies. My technical experience lies in Spark, Cloud services (Azure and AWS), CI/CD and programming languages like Python, Scala and C++. When I am not working, you have a good chance of finding me bouldering: a sport I very much like, as it spikes my creativity and problem solving on a whole other level!"

"t_6218","Hi there,

Experienced data science consultant at day, student at night. My greatest asset is curiosity, which is the driving force behind everything I do and it defines my career. 

- 'Why do people behave the way they do?' inspired me to study Psychology. 
- 'How can I prove my findings?' inspired me to get a Masters degree in Statistics. 
- 'How can I drive change with data?' is why I became a consultant. 
- 'How does it work?' is why I love open source and math.

Although I specialize in data science I am also interested and have experience in related fields like data engineering. The combination of my broad interest and consulting experience allows me to easily collaborate with all relevant stakeholders in an end-to-end data science project.

What I've learned from my PhD on consciousness is that :
1) We don't know much about consciousness, and 
2) the human brain is AMAZING at information processing and has inspired many Ai techniques.

More practically though, I've learned to code and conceptually understand Ai techniques and, importantly, their limitations. Breaking down the myth that Ai can do and solve anything, and reigning it back into real-life applications that bring practical solutions for your problems is what I specialise in.

My data scientist and data engineer friends, a.k.a. the ""Nerds/Geeks"", think that I'm a 'salesperson' and have crossed to the dark side. My previous colleagues from business teams think I'm a nerd. I guess that leaves me perfectly stranded in the no-man's land between technical and commercial people where important info often gets lost in translation.

I make sure the right information gets to the right people in order to create complete and operational custom Ai solutions. Thereby creating real-life value by matching Ai techniques with business context, end-users, KPI's and technical possibilities.

He was offered a postdoctoral position in the research group of Nobel prize winner Professor Lord George Porter at Imperial College in London but decided to choose a business oriented career path: his academic background is still visible in the fact that Marcel is highly content-driven. That does not mean, however, that he does not have a sharp eye for human interaction. On the contrary, Marcel‚Äôs management style is characterized by the words: ‚Äúhard on contents, soft in relationships‚Äù. Generally, people like to co-operate with him.
Marcel started his career at Siemens as a Product Specialist, mainly catalyzing the sales of MRI scanners. During this period, he introduced and co-ordinated scientific research projects, engaged by academic hospitals and Siemens. This was so successful that Siemens decided to sponsor his MBA at the Rotterdam School of Management. After that, Marcel‚Äôs attention shifted to project management and, as such, he led projects varying in scale from small, in health care institutions, to large, in financial institutions. Currently, he is a certified and seasoned project / program manager having acquired more than 20 years experience in that field.

"t_6402","I am a machine learning scientist at Bayer working on deep learning applications in drug discovery. I was trained as a biochemist and have over 10 years of experience programming and analyzing data using python.

I obtained a Ph.D. in a highly computational sub-field of biochemistry. The aim of this work was to determine three-dimensional folds of biomolecules. My day to day work involved development of computational methods and algorithms to extract information and insight from the raw and ambiguous data provided by our machines. My research work ultimately led to the first successful calculation of a membrane protein structural model in native lipids using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

"t_6407","Initially a chemist, I have finally found my niche as a data researcher who follows the scientific method to solve problems in both the tech and finance industries. The current shorthand term for this in the industry would be ""Quant"", but that terms tends to be reductive and evokes an image of faceless computer jockeys in a windowless back room crunching numbers for half of a day. Good Quants/Data Scientists/Analysts can use statistical and research methods to find answers to find the answers they seek, but great Quants/Data Scientists/Analysts can take those conceptually complex findings and effectively explain them clearly across all job types and skill levels. I work hard to fall in that latter designation.

Linear Models tot en met Generalized Linear Mixed Models, Bayesian Statistics, Survival Analysis, Multivariate en Multidimensional Data Analysis, High Dimensional Data Analysis, Statistical Learning (bijv.

"t_6507","As far as I can remember I had a passion for problem solving. This manifested itself as a love for mathematics and then computer science, especially algorithms, in high school. I took part in numerous competitions during those years and decided this is what I want to pursue as my career. Having studied at a german school in Romania, going to University in Germany followed naturally. I chose Munich and the TUM for its high standards, rigor and variety. I got a full scholarship from the DAAD and did both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Munich. My affinity for mathematics made me choose a maths minor for my Bachelor's, specializing on statistics and stochasticity. Continuing on this foundation, I focused on machine learning for my masters and was involved in research work as well, regarding stochastic games. I gathered practical experience from working on a deepfake detection framework and a traffic scenario clustering algorithm. For my thesis I tacked classification and forecasting for time series data by developing a novel neural network architecture based on polynomial splines.

After all these years, my passion lives on and I am looking to apply my knowledge in finding the best solutions for tasks in the field of data science, just as finding the optimum algorithm for a competitive programming exercise."

"t_6697","Here is a small blurb about me and what I do: 
I am Tushar, an Applied Scientist-2 at Amazon Search in the M5 team. We work on building representations that are multi-entity, multi-modal, multi-lingual, multi-locale, and multi-task (M5), and will utilize all available data for each entity and their combination. These representations are trained on 1000x more data, and have 1000x more parameters than the largest models in current use at Amazon.

One of my projects is to create images index-able and searchable along with text using multimodal models like CLIP and ALBEF. This helps improve the suite of tasks and is adopted by Search, Ads CTR team - leading to predicted annualized lift of $48.7MM OPS. Prior to this, I worked as Research Engineer and then Research Scientist at Verisk Analytics. During this time, I worked on multiple projects like using active learning to speed up training of LLMs by 2.5x, Document Intelligence tasks (submission to ACL 2023), and core machine learning modelling applications like vector-quantized normalizing flows (UAI 2022) and Optimal Transport. Prior to this, at NYU I worked with esteemed professors like Yann Lecun on developing world models for text-based games in tandem with exploration techniques via memory-based Neural Networks. Moreover, with Prof Rob Fergus, we developed novel architecture for multi-agent controlled continuous communication over cooperative, competitive and mixed tasks in RL set-up (ICLR 2019).

"t_7107","I am an Artificial Intelligence researcher. Until recently I worked as a consultant and freelance data scientist, but for the next couple of years I will be pursuing a PhD in artificial intelligence.

I have built a startup based on an AI system of my own design to automate many types of software tasks, especially in Data Science.

I always look for new and creative ways to solve problems. But at the same time, I care more about practical results than about theory.

This allows me to identify opportunities and challenges that other people miss, and to find new ways to drive profit.

Other scientists often focus on sharpening their skills with their favorite algorithms. This tends to lead to ""when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail"". I instead focus on the ability to always pick the right tool for the job. I achieved some of my biggest successes in data science by inventing my own custom AI algorithms specifically for the problem at hand.

I have been working as an independent AI researcher since high school. My research has enabled me to create profitable custom AI algorithms at Volkswagen and Huawei. I received a research grant even though I am not in academia. The idea for my startup Elody was also a result of my research.

My programming skills are competitive on the national level. I was a finalist of a national programming competition, and won the award for the most creative ideas, nationwide. I have experience working as a full-stack developer from building a tech startup.

All of this is because of my main goal in life: I want to understand how thinking works. I want to know why people make the decisions they do, how data and rigorous techniques can improve on human abilities, and how the full breadth of human intelligence can be replicated in a machine.

I am pursuing a PhD in AI. I am trying to figure out how to emulate introspection in an AI. I believe that this is a key component of consciousness, and current AI technologies do not exhibit this ability at all.

In more practical terms, my research is related to Continual Learning: Teaching a single AI to be able to do many different tasks, without getting confused by this as contemporary systems do. Companies currently have to throw away existing models and replace them with newly trained ones from scratch, instead of improving an existing model. This is very wasteful, and I want to find a way to fix that."

"t_7304","My interest in how we humans perceive, process, and through our beliefs shape our environment has driven me to study Cognitive Science in Osnabr√ºck in 2014. During my time there, I did not only gain knowledge and skills about cutting-edge technology and research, but I‚Äôve also got into a vibrant community of curious and inspiring people. 
From controlling your own dreams through lucid dreaming to machines that  `dream up` texts, music or images through Generative Adversarial Networks - Cognitive Science offers a colourful mix of different topics.

During the last year of my bachelor studies, my focus became clear: I wanted to learn more about social cognition and how individuals interact in groups and I wanted to approach this topic from a computational perspective. 

I finished my Bachelor's studies with a thesis on social norms and started my Master's in Data Science in Groningen where I completed an internship in the Norms & Networks cluster of the sociology faculty. 
In Groningen, I could deepen my technical skills and learned a lot about the theories of social influence. My Master thesis dealt with the question of whether YouTube‚Äôs recommendation algorithm is facilitating the political radicalization of the platform‚Äôs users, and how machine learning methods can help to answer this question.

As a versatile professional, I've had the opportunity to wear many hats at KptnCook, including those of a Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Business Analyst. My journey involved developing robust data infrastructure, constructing cutting-edge services on top of it, and leveraging data analytics to drive critical business decisions. Thanks to my diverse background, I'm a well-rounded expert in all things data.

As someone who is always eager to learn and grow, I'm now seeking new opportunities to apply my knowledge and expertise to fresh challenges. Whether it's diving into new technologies, exploring innovative solutions to complex problems, or simply taking on exciting new projects, I'm ready to take on whatever comes my way."

"t_7591","I didn't start coding at the age of 12. In fact, I wasn't into technology at a young age. My use of a computer was limited to paint and solitaire. Now, I am writing code to process complex data and extract useful information that is meaningful in healthcare.

During adolescence, instead of investing time in understanding technology, I spent it practicing sports. From team sports such as basketball and football to individual sports such as swimming, surfing, and kickboxing. I loved every time I started something new: getting to know the people dynamics, learning new rules and techniques. I was all about experimenting new things. 

Maximizing the variety of topics I would be exposed to was also a reason for enrolling in Biomedical Engineering. From Physics to Physiology, from Biomechanics to Biology, with some Computer Science in between. Another reason was that I would engage in meaningful work.  Developing solutions that allow healthcare practitioners to achieve great patient outcomes keeps me motivated to work hard. 

During the BSc, I had my first experience with programming. I was not looking forward to it as I was scared that my lack of engagement with technology would be a disadvantage. It wasn't. I learned to enjoy programming and have used it for image processing, and data analysis. My perspective on technology changed and I am thankful to be able to get the most out of it.

With time, I felt I should focus on specific topics. My interest in medical imaging and the excitement of an international experience led to an MSc in Diagnostic Imaging and Instrumentation in the Netherlands. Moreover, this allowed me to do two internships and a thesis, hence, more exploration. It was during one of these internships that I had my first experience in applying AI to the medical field. I fell for it due to how meaningful the work felt and how much there was yet to uncover. Therefore, I spent the last 1.5 years diving deeper into the field. 

I hope this leaves you with a clearer picture of where I came from, and what sparks my interest.

My name is Daniel, and I am on the path to becoming a Data Scientist. My current goal is to get my hands dirty with data in order to find patterns and provide powerful insights. If you have a data surplus, I am equipped to help with that. 

Data Science is not what I have always done, but I can trace it back and find the pattern. When I worked in Marketing I devoted myself to build models to simulate the market and coordinate projects that enhanced the IoT infrastructure. 

When I worked in Controlling I built a dashboard that provided the daily reporting on billing and WIPs, providing the most updated report daily in order to inform management decisions. This information was delivered to 30 people daily, and informed most of their progress. 

Even when I was studying to be an economics, my favorite courses were Statistics and Econometrics. 

All of this lead me to where I am, studying to obtain my masters degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics. Having studied Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Data Mining, Big Data Analytics and Management, I am equipped to handle real world challenges. 

This summer I will start my thesis, and want to work while I do it. I was never good at handling a half full plate. Ideally, I will study Deep Learning or Computational Intelligence for Optimization.

"t_7748","I am an ambitious jack of many trades with a knack for creative problem-solving, and a good sense of humor. 
As far back as high school, I had a knack for programming, to the point where classmates would approach me to write math programs on their calculators. I'd frequently spend my afternoons designing new algorithms for the satisfaction of it, and the joy of gaining insights as to how such programs worked.

Through studying AI, my joy for programming evolved into a passion for data science, and I took great joy in collaborating in teams on a variety of project topics, including machine learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, and deep learning.
Next to my academic achievements, I take pride in personal ones as well. I've made an active effort to pursue new challenges, and develop myself through new experiences.

As such, in an attempt to bridge the gap between student and teacher, I established a study committee, and discovered a passion for teaching and tutoring by organizing support lectures. 
Through various roles within my committee, I greatly enjoyed collaborating with others towards a common goal, which benefits my fellow students. Not only was it inspiring and rewarding, but it also taught me to be an integral part of a team, manage working groups, and connect with others.

Moreover, I challenged myself to engage in improv comedy theatre, a frightful endeavor to most, yet one which proved to be an excellent opportunity to improve my soft-skills, communication, and interactions with (international) students of wildly different disciplines. 

I am eager to cross the gap between academia and industry, and apply my knowledge and skills in a practical environment. I have a passion to inspire and support my peers on both a professional and personal level, and highly value environments that encourage personal development and growth.

"t_7862","I was a self-proclaimed ‚ÄúGolden Retriever‚Äù. At first, the catch-all title was meant to simplify and justify the multitude of roles I filled: engineer, business analyst, writer, coder, advisor, and educator. Just one word, encompassing my many interests. It also captured the essence of what I deeply enjoy ‚Äì following my curiosity. Changing minds. Empowering people. 
 
My career path came about serendipitously. I started studying Applied Physics because I dreamed of designing the technologies of the future. Even though I am still enthusiastic about physics to this day, I discovered another passion: Business and Entrepreneurship. Blending both into a double degree, I learned to look at the current business environment with much more understanding and from a very diÔ¨Äerent perspective. It made me aware of the complex logistics of operating a business and would eventually assist me in bridging the gap between business and engineering, which is my ultimate passion. But that‚Äôs only half of the story. 
 
The other half reveals: a basic nerd. Ever since I was young, I have tried to understand the underlying principles of technologies and made a hobby of experimenting with them. This sense of curiosity and exploration instilled a love for lifelong learning. In fact, I developed such a deep love of learning during academics that my long-term dream is to become a part-time lecturer. This dream now manifests into a passion for innovation and entrepreneurship, for business and strategy, and for leadership and psychology. In particular, a desire to assist the new generation of start-ups, businesses, and technologies and to foster a love and culture of responsible innovation. 
 
Walking the halls of Stanford, I wondered how I could ever fit all my passions into a single profession. Today, I no longer feel the need to simplify my identity or describe myself with one word. Personally, the time for career linearity is over - I now make it my life mission to keep growing and try out different shoes until I find a combination that fits just right.

"t_7886","I am deeply fascinated by technological advances and how they seemingly change the way we live our lives. With a simple swipe on our phone, we are now able to access new means of transportation, communication and delivery options - all for the sake of convenience and simplicity. The fact that many of us (myself included) are not able to grasp the immense complexity behind these systems and the amount of human and technological effort that goes on behind the scenes to make all of it seem so simple, makes it even more fascinating to me.

This appreciation for technology and human creativity has sparked my curiosity for the field of data science, programming and AI. Through various engagements, I was able to learn different technologies and tackle different problems and find solutions for them independently and through extensive collaboration with colleagues.

I am able to analyze complex datasets, create machine learning models, deploy applications to the cloud and perform data management tasks."

I spent a large part of my early working life in the Enterprise Java world, building applications ranging from the very small to the very large but always with a focus on innovation and quality. Millions of people have seen and/or used my work.

In 2009 I switched to developing all my projects in Scala and since then I have never looked back.

I founded the Dutch Scala Enthusiasts user group in late 2009. I'm well-connected in the Scala community and I have spoken about Scala at multiple national and international conferences.

I am the author of a number of open source Scala libraries, most prominently a non-blocking Scala client library for the Riak key/value store based on Akka and Spray called riak-scala-client. I sometimes contribute to the Spray project, soon to be merged into Akka as akka-http.

I have quite a bit of experience in the NoSQL area, having used Riak, Redis, MongoDB, and HBase on multiple projects. I've done a number of big data crunching projects using Hadoop through Scala tools like Scoobi and Scalding. I was also a co-organizer of the Dutch NoSQL Meetup group.

Around 2011 I got curious about Objective-C and since then I've helped develop a few iOS apps, including a mobile banking app for one of the largest banks in the Netherlands. That said, Objective-C is not my main focus and my skills have faded away a bit.

I love new technology and I spend a lot of time learning new things and keeping my skills near the bleeding edge.

The new distributed work experience along with IoT (according to Cisco 100 billion devices by 2025) as part of the digital transformation and the new digital services, are merely just a process challenge and data is more than just the new oil. IoT (and 5G in future) allows us to re-imagine the processes, including but not limited to healthcare. Data is now available at our finger touch anywhere in the world in seconds.

In my experience, I am finding that the pace of innovation and cycle of new technologies can sometimes be overwhelming. Most organizations are trying to catch up with the technology the best they can, in order to get through the digital transformation journey. In addition to the complexity of processes, CIO/CTO/CDO are overwhelmed with the unprecedented ""Data Tsunami"".

We see a lot of our customers being increasingly challenged with the amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, distributed in hybrid cloud, edge and on-prem. We help customers with data governance, data security and data movement. When it comes to IoT project, the next level ""Data Tsunami"" meets reality.  

Healthcare providers can‚Äôt rely on the traditional practice of deploying expensive, time-consuming governance frameworks. Depending on the country, they have to deal with extensive regulations such as HIPAA, PIPEDA, GDPR, with the implementation schedules stretching into multiple years. By the time the new system is fully integrated, the data governance environment will have changed so much that the solution in place will no longer be useful. We leverage Blockchain technology‚Äôs peer-to-peer network verification capabilities to ensure that data assets, algorithms, and their respective analytics are effectively tamper-proof. We ensure patients are in charge of their data again.

Since I was a little kid, I‚Äôve loved solving puzzles and been intrigued by the ways things work. Following my childhood enthusiasm, I went to Germany to study chemistry. Chemistry is fascinating and allows me to see what other people might ignore or not see. Look around you: chemistry is everywhere and in every cell of your body. But I yearned to learn more - I want to know what exactly happens in a chemical reaction, why the molecules can interact with each other, why this particular material has a blue colour but not yellow and so on. Therefore, I gravitated towards quantum chemistry - applying quantum mechanics to explain a countless number of my chemistry questions. The thing I love about quantum mechanics is: it is enigmatic and perplexing at first; but once you grasp it, its unique beauty will amaze you. 

My interest is not stopping there just for quantum chemistry. Working in this field, I realised most of the tasks could be automated with coding. And that‚Äôs when it happened: I felt inside me a spark that ignited and a burst of joy, when I printed out ‚ÄúHello, Anh!‚Äù on the Linux terminal with my Python code. I couldn‚Äôt help myself: I read through ‚ÄúIntroduction to Computing Using Python‚Äù by Ljubomir Perkovic and did all the examples and exercises from the book within a week. Since then, I never stop expanding my programing knowledge and coding skills. I‚Äôve written numerous scripts with Python, R and Bash that make my life easy. 

I could see more power of Python and R when some of the projects in my PhD involves data science. Using Python and R, I can conveniently play with data, analyse it and plot nice-looking graphs (I‚Äôm obsessed with beauty and colours, so yes, the graphs need to be not only meaningful but also pretty).

My passion for coding has grown even stronger with my main PhD project - building a quantum chemical program in C++. Through this project, I‚Äôve learnt so much more about programming, compilers, algorithms and mathematics. 

Outside my PhD, I dedicate my time to entrepreneurial activities. I‚Äôm passionate about taking actions that create impacts and deliver social goods. I love generating ideas, taking risks and solving problems creatively. Most importantly, I have to face many challenges which give me opportunities to learn, to update my skills and to thrive.

Cueball: When did we forget our dreams?
Friend: What?

Cueball: The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind. The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox.

We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.

But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold.

[The friend still stands while Cueball looks at his computer.]
Cueball: When did we forget our dreams?
Friend: What?
[Cueball stands beside his friend.]
Cueball: The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind. The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out before us. We see the same things every day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.
Cueball: And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.

"t_8603","I believe, a realistic productionable machine learning (ML) application requires a holistic approach, considering all aspects, including ML requirements, and existing infrastructure. An ML model, trained with selective data and in the closed environment of a Data Scientist's laptop, often overlooks many environments and deployment constraints. In nutshell, the growth of AI in any environment depends greatly on the deployment capabilities such as accommodating and optimising new model architectures quickly, and so on. 

In my master's thesis, I identified several existing drawbacks and construct solutions to mitigate the disadvantage in an actual production environment. I successfully implemented a continuous training machine learning pipeline with the ability to monitor the pipeline and modify the pipeline in the production environment. I worked on other significant aspects of the ML pipeline such as pipeline scheduling, data validation, re-training, model validation and deployment.

My dream is to make machine learning more approachable. In my current workplace, I developed ‚ÄúDagGenerator‚Äù which creates a TensorFlow Extended pipeline from JSONs. To achieve this, I created several model templates consisting of various Neural Net architectures which are compliant with JSON. These pipelines are also tested after their creation, making them deployment ready.  

I consider myself a tech enthusiast, quick learner, self-motivated and risk-taker. My strength lies in my creativity and dedication. I believe that the bigger the challenge is more fun to solve it."

"t_8703","I love generating new ideas and coding hard to make them work (or rework them üòÜ). I feature-engineer and distribute them to bright minds through focused writings, teachings and fantastic teamwork. So here's five quick things about me and my work.   
 
‚úîÔ∏è 1.   Everything has a point; This summary (I guess) but also 3D point clouds. They are made of a lot of points ü§ì. Sometimes billion of points. And I worked for the last ten years to make a point: context is critical for point clouds to retain a whole meaning. See my point?

‚úîÔ∏è 2.   I am deeply intrigued by the nature of intelligence, consciousness, love and power. Thus, I am a book and podcast addict, and I love listening to everyone's take on life. So, how do you define intelligence? Is it linked with consciousness? (careful AI-experts üòâ)

‚úîÔ∏è 3.   When I was ten years old, I wanted to be a teacher. Twenty years later, having worked for private and public entities, I found that I genuinely want to help people and teams grow in their passion/mission. I chose to specialize in the 3D (geo)data science & AI niche because it is freaking amazing, and I am good at it ü§©.

‚úîÔ∏è 4.   I anticipated new tech trends with surprising accuracy in the past, and I am still figuring out if it was sheer luck üçÄ or if I am sensitive to the force.

‚úîÔ∏è 5.   I wonder how many of these five lines are needed by a state-of-the-art AI architecture to (a) find me as the best match through 7.5B humans and (b) generate a virtual copy with a spatial delimitation or 3D geometry?"

2. The right methodologies: Combining creativity with structure through elements of design-, systems-, and first-principles-thinking to create truly innovative solutions.

3. Being Agile rather than doing Agile: Embracing change, failing early and often. Learning is always the goal.

4. Being Mindful of ourselves and others: We must prioritize our (mental-) health, (work-)relationships, community, and the environment if we want to grow and create value for others in the long run. You can't pour from an empty cup.

5. Full Responsibility: Taking responsibility puts us back into the driver's seat and liberates and empowers us to make decisions. In strong companies, people are empowered to make decisions. Good ideas win over politics.

In addition, with Craft Your Life I help young people design their future by combining modern coaching techniques, and practical business and engineering methodologies with ancient wisdom. You can find out more under craftyourlife.net.

"t_8800","I love generating new ideas and coding hard to make them work (or rework them üòÜ). I feature-engineer and distribute them to bright minds through focused writings, teachings and fantastic teamwork. So here's five quick things about me and my work.   
 
‚úîÔ∏è 1.   Everything has a point; This summary (I guess) but also 3D point clouds. They are made of a lot of points ü§ì. Sometimes billion of points. And I worked for the last ten years to make a point: context is critical for point clouds to retain a whole meaning. See my point?

‚úîÔ∏è 2.   I am deeply intrigued by the nature of intelligence, consciousness, love and power. Thus, I am a book and podcast addict, and I love listening to everyone's take on life. So, how do you define intelligence? Is it linked with consciousness? (careful AI-experts üòâ)

‚úîÔ∏è 3.   When I was ten years old, I wanted to be a teacher. Twenty years later, having worked for private and public entities, I found that I genuinely want to help people and teams grow in their passion/mission. I chose to specialize in the 3D (geo)data science & AI niche because it is freaking amazing, and I am good at it ü§©.

‚úîÔ∏è 4.   I anticipated new tech trends with surprising accuracy in the past, and I am still figuring out if it was sheer luck üçÄ or if I am sensitive to the force.

‚úîÔ∏è 5.   I wonder how many of these five lines are needed by a state-of-the-art AI architecture to (a) find me as the best match through 7.5B humans and (b) generate a virtual copy with a spatial delimitation or 3D geometry?"

"t_9120","Research Engineer experienced in Mixed Reality (MR) software development and Augmented Reality (AR). I worked with Microsoft Hololens 2, combining Artificial Intelligence and MR to bring enhanced situational awareness for Air Traffic Control at Saab-NTU Joint Lab, Singapore.

Phase 1 - The goal was to build a Spatial Augmented Reality visualization prototype by projecting 3D projection mapping onto 3D printed Singapore Changi Airport model and analyze the obstacle avoidance in static and dynamic mode. A* algorithm used for finding the path in real time and simulation done in Unity 3D. Moreover, I also added a depth sensing feature integrated with the running simulation which results in controlling the aircraft and terminals of airport using hand gestures. So, while moving the objects the aircraft re route to the shortest path to the destination in real time. This has potential to use for analyzing and airport planning. The working prototype I built was for Air Traffic Management Research Institute (NTU-ATMRI, Singapore) and Saab-NTU Joint Lab. This multilayered project involved 3D printing, depth sensing, Spatial Augmented Reality, and AI algorithms. This project also got featured in prestigious NTU, Singapore official Facebook page.

Phase 2 - The project involves building an airport simulation in Mixed Reality(MR) in Microsoft HoloLens 2 and comparing Air Traffic Controllers' tasks to an out of the window view in a conventional control tower. The study conducted with the MR prototype taking feedback of Air Traffic Controllers from Singapore Changi Airport for this project got accepted at prestigious USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research & Development(ATM R&D) 2021 Seminar conducted by Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) and EUROCONTROL as research paper ""Embodied multimodal interaction with a portable mixed reality-based digital tower.""

Phase 3- The project involves training models using Machine Learning to detect aircraft and Computer Vision in Mixed Reality platforms and integrated with 360 degree digital tower of ATMRI (NTU), Singapore.

Phase 4- successfully built a collaborative system networked between two Hololens 2 MR visualization interact over clouds. For this phase invited Air Traffic Controllers from France, India, Singapore and Hong Kong to test the Mixed Reality prototype. This test was successful and research study got accepted at prestigious ISMAR 2022, Singapore."

Empowering and enabling people is the key to building a great company.  To accelerate the adoption of advanced AI in a high-regulated environment, I have been involved in different roles such as Head of Data, Principal Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineering Lead at different organizations such as Mollie, ING, Wehkamp, TomTom, and SDL in setting up the strategic vision, roadmap, and materialization of its Data and ML Platform capabilities at a global scale. If I must reflect on my experience with the number of years as a KPI, I have around 17 years of professional experience in building large-scale distributed Data Systems with seven years of management experience as a strategic leader managing data and ML strategy, execution roadmap, and scaling teams to 30+ FTE from scratch. 

From my professional experiences of the last 15+ years experience in building highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed systems as a Technical Lead/Architect, if I have learned one thing, that is - ""an escalator can never break: it can only become stairs,"" a trait that every software system should inherently adhere to. I consider myself a technical leader with a strong computer science foundation, a passion for solving computational problems, and a visionary who can set a technical roadmap with a strategic direction in place. 

""Walking along the line with others is living, while rest are waiting."" I consider myself someone who will take it on and make it happen. For a faster adaptation of technology, an organization requires building an engineering DNA with care and time. And a vibrant community is a key element in the pursuit of that. I am involved (as an organizer and a participant) in local communities in the Netherlands and frequently give talks on the topics of leadership, data strategy, functional programming, distributed software architecture, ML Engineering, and so on at international conferences such as VLDB, FlinkForward, Scala By the Bay, Scala eXchange, flatMap(Oslo), CurryOn to name a few."

The financial needs of small-city India have been largely underserved since traditional players and even fintechs are unable to properly serve this segment

* We have raised $25.75Mn equity ($115.5 Mn valuation) from British International Investment (UK Government's sovereign impact fund formally known as CDC), Sony Japan, 3one4 Capital, Kalaari, Picus and Orios.

* WeRize is a full-stack provider, manufacturing, risk managing and distributing a wide portfolio of customized credit, insurance, and savings products for 300Mn individuals spread across the 4000+ Tier 2 to Tier 4 cities . This $200 Billion market expects a very different product set as well as distribution model which traditional private banks, insurers, and mutual funds are unable to provide. The economics of these products as well as operating in small cities for traditional companies is unfeasible due to their high-cost branch-based distribution model.

* Families in small towns require high touch sales/after-sales service which can only be profitably provided using a social distribution model. The entire Indian fintech ecosystem is geared towards building DIY apps that help customers choose the right financial products for themselves. However, this approach doesn‚Äôt work for small-town families as they need high touch sales and after sales. Additionally, due to lower ticket-size/conversions vs tier-1 city millennial customers, digital CAC unit economics dont work, leading to fintechs staying away from this superb segment

*Using the ‚ÄúSocial Shopify of Finance‚Äù platform, WeRize has enabled thousands of financially literate freelancers in 1000+ cities to sell its financial products in their social circle. This solves trust issue as well as provides high-touch sales/after-sales .

* Werize is the only Indian fintech platform/financial services player that has been able to distribute financial services through freelancers without any of its own feet-on-street/local branches. Our freelancers in 1000+ cities are managed only through Werize proprietary tech platform. This enables superb scalability and low CAC/ops cost=> highly profitable business model.

After that, I use the relevant data to build a model that best serves the solution. This model will be evaluated and improved until it provides the first acceptable (by client) results. Then, the model will be integrated into the existing software landscape. The integration process involves working together with the client to ensure a seamless adoption. Last but not least, when the solution is in use, the feedback will be gathered to optimise the model. The full pipeline from creating to updating the models, will be on the cloud as a continuous integration cycle. By using this approach I rapidly deliver tangible results to the clients."

I am working at Averbis in Freiburg (Germany) on developing & deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g. Transformers) for extracting relevant information (e.g. diagnoses, medications, laboratory values, protected health information) from medical records. This requires a range of NLP tasks (sequence labeling; annotation-, relation and document classification; similarity matching). The goal is to simplify the documentation process for health care professionals and to use the potential of unstructured medical records.

My background is in mathematics (MSc) and computer science (MSc.) with a PhD in the field of brain-computer interfaces. Most of my work lies at the intersection of machine learning and health care.

I am experienced in a broad range of programming languages and tools, especially with the Python ML Stack (Tensorflow, Pandas, Transformers, PyTorch, Streamlit, Cleanlab, Scikit-Learn, etc.), deploying models in Java UIMA, deployment (Docker), development tools (Git, Jenkins) and limited experience in App-design (Flutter) & web development.

"t_9848","Describing oneself can be rather complicated, as the spectrum of our mind lacks the necessary objectivity for the task. For the aforementioned reason, I will stick to an adumbration of my motivations and my objectives.
As Theodore von K√°rm√°n, a famous engineer, once said: ""Scientists discover the world that exists; engineers create the world that never was"". Being raised in a family of high-school professors, inside an environment full of scientific and artistic stimuli, I grew to believe that the plain discovery of the principles governing the universe, which is in itself a very important task, cannot suffice unless we use this knowledge to engineer ""a world that never was"", a better one.
My juvenile admiration for technology and computers, led me to choose Electrical and Computer Engineering as the path to contribute to this cause. The beginning of my studies though, coincided with Greece entering its largest economic crisis since World War II, with significant parts of its population experiencing poverty and unemployment and with social injustice deteriorating. Witnessing the consequences of such a recession, I came to understand that the blind pursuit of a fancier and more evolved world is not enough, unless it improves the lives of all people indiscriminately.
TU Delft, except for building on top of the strong foundation of my diploma in Patra with specialized knowledge and technical skills, allowed me to meet and work with people from all over the world, with different backgrounds and views on scientific, technical and social aspects of technology. This cooperation directed my focus in contributing to industries with distinct social impact like healthcare and green technology. The exact location of my next stop though, is not yet determined.
I know that my boat for such a long and difficult journey should be made of inspiration, determination, innovation and hard work. And as my fellow Greek, poet Cavafy stated in his renowned poem ""Ithaca"", even if I don't reach my destination or if I find it less imposing than I imagined, I will have gotten rich in experiences just by traveling."

"t_9887","I am an engineer in training and an explorer at heart. Having been raised in a multi-cultural environment of bilingual students from all four corners of the world, I quickly learnt about the benefits of people coming together to achieve great things. The space industry had always represented to me one of these great collaborations in engineering. With projects like the ISS and the Apollo program, I was always fascinated in the excellence in engineering, the collaboration reflected, and the drive for discovery that the aerospace industry holds. I saw in this field the new explorers of our time. This time they didn't have the name of Marco Polo or Magellan but were called Voyager and Curiosity and were exploring our solar system and our world. I also saw how space not only allowed us to look further into the stars but also helped connect us all together. Since then, I have always wanted to be able to participate in fields that seeks to better mankind.

I started my studies by setting off to Boston to earn a combined B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Physics at Northeastern University. I was able to learn engineering and physics skills while also having the chance to work in places such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Protonex. Here I learned how to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice and had the chance to lead test programs on mechanisms that were used on Mars. Wanting to learn more about the aerospace field, I then headed to the Netherlands to get an M.S. in Aerospace engineering with a specialization in space engineering. Here I had the chance to lead the build of a small aircraft and have been part of the Assembly and Integration team of the first Dutch student built CubeSat, which will be used to educate students about space all across the Netherlands. 

I am now looking to finally join the workforce and help a new engineering project grow. I bring a varied amount of experience in thermal, mechanical, and testing engineering but I also bring with me a thirst for learning and improving. In this website I share the different experiences I have had throughout my young career as an engineer and would be happy to talk and share about my experiences with anyone interested in contacting me.

Het was een prachtig park langs de ruige kust tussen Mal√∂ en G√∂teborg. De stop zou een half uur duren. Een vriend en ik keken elkaar aan en renden zo snel mogelijk zo ver mogelijk weg. We renden over het gras, over de heuvels naar de rotswanden. We klommen langs kolonies meeuwen via de rostwand naar beneden. Benden, geklemd tussen een paar stenen, keken we naar hoe de golven tegen de rotswand aan sloegen. De wind en de golven waren luid met af een toe een schreeuwende meeuw. Ik keek op mijn horloge: nog 15 minuten voor de bus vertrok. We klommen snel weer omhoog, renden over de heuvels en terug over het gras. We zagen de rest van de groep in de bus weer instappen en sloten achteraan in de rij.

Ik vertel dit verhaal omdat deze situatie mij goed beschrijft. Ik ben echt een ontdekker en avonturier. Als je mij √©√©n uur de tijd geeft dan besteed ik de helft daarvan om zo ver mogelijk te verkennen en de andere helft om weer terug te komen. Dit verkennen en ontdekken uit zich in meer dan alleen om me heen kijken. Ik vind het fantastisch om in mijn vrije tijd nieuwe projecten op te pakken en uit te zoeken.

"t_10168","Good health is easy. Eat well, move your body, sleep enough‚Ä¶ right?

Turns out, it's far from as simple as I once believed back when I first started elementary school biology. As it stands, health is a much more complex and multidimensional concept, something which I am intimately familiar with today. Underlying mechanisms for health are deep roots and require thorough, high quality epidemiological research to make sense of and disentangle.

So‚Ä¶ I decided to become an Epidemiologist!

For me, quality is everything. Poor data, inappropriate study design and improper analytical techniques can ruin what could be a very valid and important question. To achieve quality, I believe in two things. One, transparency between stakeholders. In order to facilitate good clinical practice and efficient research, all stakeholders need to be keenly aware of the research process. Two, ensuring a high internal validity. In other words, providing proper material and immaterial resources to the research team so that the research produces the most ethical and high-quality results possible.

At this point, you might ask ‚ÄúAnd how would you provide the services required for these ideas?‚Äù and I shall tell you how. As an Epidemiologist and public health specialist, I bring:

-Education and training in all steps of the clinical research process from start to finish.
-Advanced statistical knowledge, experience and skills related to clinical and observational research.
-Writing and management of study documentation and grant requests.
-Ability to disseminate research results to a wide variety of stakeholders.
-Knowledge and understanding of the public health impact of clinical research
-Practical skills such as programming in R, data collection methods, RedCAP, Relational databases,SPSS, SAS, Microsoft Office and more .

‚Ä¶ And there is more where that came from. Got any interesting opportunities, or perhaps just want to chat about anything health science related? Drop me a message!

"t_10469","Making a profession out of his hobby is the best thing that can happen to a person. 
When I was young, I was already interested in IT and participated in several communities focused on Research and Development. 
As such, I started working as a developer focusing on 4GL languages. 
The internet came along, and the first steps with dynamic web pages came into the picture.
After four years, I started my own company, focusing on contact centers. 
I have worked on many projects, from developing interfaces in C++ and setting up complete contact centers, including CRM and CTI, to building user interfaces and BI reporting.
During this period, the company started growing, and other opportunities came along. 
As such, I became more involved in product research and development. 
I constructed a product called Genesys Web Toolbar, a contact center agent desktop. The product was widely used by companies like Swedbank, SFR, Groupama, ...
Since the SAAS applications gained speed, I have been focussing on AWS. As such, I made a Mobile Platform, connecting to Genesys and Amazon Connect, using microservices, all running on the AWS Fargate platform. This application allows mobile users to handle contact center interactions easily and intuitively.
Due to the rapid change in technology, I keep focussing on new opportunities  to make sure we can provide the best applications for our end users"

"t_10509","Kelly is a certified .NET developer, likes to be a better tennis player, loves to ski in the backcountry and is interested in most technical subjects, geeky or less-geeky.

Kelly's latest interest is .NET Core, the cross-platform version of a framework he has used throughout his career, including ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.
And it's not just the framework itself. Being able to create cross-platform applications opens a whole new world of - especially DevOps - tools that weren't available for the Microsoft stack before.
What's more to like for someone with a master's degree in engineering, specifically IT and electronics?
And learning never stops. That's why he will try to obtain a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven in 2021.

On a personal level, Kelly always aims to be a team-player and values everyone's opinion, including his own. In a good team, everything is open for discussion but decisions have got to be made.
He is a more rational than emotional person but prefers being surrounded by naive optimists above informed pessimists.

In winter, he spends more weekends - including fridays - freeriding the Alps than at home.

He learned what it is like to work together as a team and to deal with different personalities. As a referee, discipline is key! He had to be 100% focused for every game and remain consistent in his decision-making. He also learned a lot about different leadership styles and interpersonal relationships and interactions. In a way, being a referee taught him how to be social. 

After being voted socially most deserving student as a senior in high school, his interest in social relationships broadened to include business-related networking events and intercultural relationships. This encouraged him to participate in a volunteer project in Wa, Ghana: a period filled with lessons on cross-cultural interaction, different corporate cultures and religions. This life-changing project sparked a desire for international exploration.
 
Arthur took every opportunity to gain international experience as part of his education. He moved to Bordeaux, France for four months to take his classes there. He also pulled out all the stops to do his internship at Flanders Investment and Trade in Atlanta, USA. He had the privilege to do another internship as a digital marketeer within a Peruvian company based in Barcelona.

- UoE Master's Dissertation: Predicting vocal tract shapes using speaker dependent and independent inversion mapping features.

To conduct the research I used mocha and mngu0 - two datasets that make use of Electromagnetic Midsaggital Articulography (EMA) data. An EMA corpus typically gives three pieces of information we can use: the speech signal, the x,y,z coordinates of the articulators through time, and the prompt read. As such these corpora can be used to build models that predict where the articulators are in space at a certain time given a speech signal.

I combined Edinburgh's mngu0 and mocha EMA datasets to train a DNN Bi-LSTM that predicted where coils were through time with high accuracy and developed a codebook of shapes. I used speaker dependent and speaker independent EMA features. With speaker independent EMA features, the model achieved <1mm MSE on the validation set.

I used a local linear embedding to encode speaker dependent and independent articulatory features. The vocal tract shapes represented snapshots of where the articulators were during the articulation of English phonemes. I also analysed some samples by comparing the percentages of template snapshots e.g. 20% dental, 80% bilabial with the forced aligned phones e.g. /p/ pointing out avenues for future research with the corpora and the technology.

The inversion mapping technology I worked on is well suited for tasks like pronunciation training, talking head animation, or developing a model to enhance a speech recognition system."

I am passionate about Science and Artificial Intelligence. I believe in the power of data because data does not lie!

My goal is to be able to remove those biases in our systems and society, one step at a time. 

Just like the general society, the area of medical research is also less focused on women. Most existing medicines or treatments are tested for men and assumed to be applicable to women. However, that approach can only go so far in the field of oncology, especially breast cancer research. I have dedicated my time to this field. My work involves breast MRIs, and how to determine which patients are at a higher risk for breast cancer development at a later stage in their life.  
As an AI student, I do this with the help of Deep Learning architectures. However, the task is easier said than done, as often these 3D images need a lot of preprocessing, and are computationally expensive to work with. Plus, the fact that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) only started existing in 1971, makes them far less used in the area of oncology, especially for breast cancer diagnosis. Hence, this topic needs more research, and I am thrilled to contribute to it.

I had the chance to discover multiple programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, Javascript and SQL which helped me understand the interaction between different software components. Furthermore, I was particularly passionate about Algorithm Design and Data Structures, having participated in multiple programming contests, the last noteworthy result being at the Northwestern Europe Regional Contest (NWERC), where my team and I placed 30th out of 120.

Since I‚Äôve always wanted to expand my knowledge outside of the academic scope, I was constantly involved in multiple other projects, always trying to combine theory with practice. In my exciting journey as a full-stack freelancer, I had the opportunity to build and design real products and solve real-world challenges. My main stack is Angular + TypeORM/Firebase, having also touched others like PHP and .NET Core. Not only did I gain vast knowledge as a computer scientist, but I also truly understood the utmost importance of teamwork and collaboration, learning how to be both a team player and a leader.

AI has been one of my biggest passions over the past years, having studied courses such as ML, Computational Intelligence and Collaborative AI. Currently working as a Research Developer at MYLAPS Innovation Center, I am exploring the art of AI in Computer Vision, working on developing new and exciting products. I greatly benefited from the experience as a researcher, having written my Thesis in robust multi-label classification. Together with my mentors and professor, we released the GALC-SLR method, a multi-label DNN resistant to label noise. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02032]"

"t_10804","An international woman studying in the Netherlands in a field largely dominated by men. 
I am passionate about Science and Artificial Intelligence. I believe in the power of data because data does not lie! As a student of AI, I often come across instances of gender and other biases in our current technology empowered by AI. My goal is to be able to remove those biases in our systems and society, one step at a time. 

Just like the general society, the area of medical research is also less focused on women. Most existing medicines or treatments are tested for men and assumed to be applicable to women. However, that approach can only go so far in the field of oncology, especially breast cancer research. I have dedicated my time to this field. My work involves breast MRIs, and how to determine which patients are at a higher risk for breast cancer development at a later stage in their life.  
As an AI student, I do this with the help of Deep Learning architectures. However, the task is easier said than done, as often these 3D images need a lot of preprocessing, and are computationally expensive to work with. Plus, the fact that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) only started existing in 1971, makes them far less used in the area of oncology, especially for breast cancer diagnosis. Hence, this topic needs more research, and I am thrilled to contribute to it.

"t_10887","'Could you tell me about your experience in using X? Why did you choose it?‚Äô
‚ÄòHow did you feel about it?‚Äô
‚ÄòWhat would make your experience better?‚Äô

As a researcher, these questions always run in my mind and conversations. 

To me, research is not just about data and insights: I want to know the people behind them. 

How and why people behave in a certain way, use certain things instead of others, and how they feel about it. Who are you, and what works for you?

This insatiable curiosity about people and behaviours pushes me to continuously improve my research skills and experiences. I have worked with big datasets consisting of more than 150,000 participants, conducted over forty interviews with participants across the globe, and ran remote and moderated surveys and experiments. This experience has turned me into a solid mixed-method researcher, aware of the merits and weaknesses of various quantitative and qualitative research methods, and comfortable conducting both.

Research should be accessible and approachable.
That's my belief.

It means everyone, regardless of their background, should be able to access and understand research findings and insights. Having published my research in top 25% peer-reviewed scientific journals, and presented in front of skilled and non-skilled audiences in classes, conferences, and popular media, I pride myself a great communicator and storyteller. My audiences always compliment me on how convincing and enjoyable my presentations are.

I believe that being able to translate business requirements / logic into a technical solution and explaining a technical solution back to the business are two important skills that every data engineer should have. I pride myself in being a data engineer who also focuses on constantly developing and improving these two skills so that I can deliver the best solution to the business.

My main interests lie in (big) data engineering, cloud computing, and DataOps"
